After successful socials in September and October, we've sadly had to take the decision to pause these socials again because of changes in Covid safety in recent weeks. Indoor events are simply not safe, especially when we have so many elderly volunteers and can't be sure of people's vaccination status.

However, the activities team are still planning a trip to the ice rink in the next few weeks, which is sure to be popular!
