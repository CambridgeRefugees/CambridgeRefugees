Faraj is a fantastic cook who's trained with Yottam Ottolenghi and at Honey & Co. He's also a Syrian refugee who came to Cambridge 5 years ago, and now has his own catering business.[On the 7th of April](https://www.facebook.com/events/191300079160344/), he's sharing some of his love of cookery in an evening of cooking and chat, creating one of his favourite Syrian dishes and sharing his recipe and techniques! This traditional dish can be vegan or vegetarian, or served as a side dish.
