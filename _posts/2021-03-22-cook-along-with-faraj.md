Faraj is a Syrian refugee who came to Cambridge 5 years ago. He's a fantastic cook who's trained with Yottam Ottolenghi and at Honey & Co, and now he has his own catering business. And, on the 7th of April, he's sharing some of his love of cookery in a live lesson where you can learn to make one of his favourite Syrian dishes! You can also expect to learn something about Faraj himself, and he's even going to take questions.

If you'd like to join us for this fantastic event, please [email us](mailto:admin@cambridgerefugees.org) to book your place and get the list of ingredients you'll need to have ready.
