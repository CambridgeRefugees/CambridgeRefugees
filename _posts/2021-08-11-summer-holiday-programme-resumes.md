With a dynamic and efficient new activities team and funding from Cambridgeshire Community Foundation, the summer holiday programme got off to a successful start with a day trip to Hunstanton on 31 July. Two coaches left from the Backs at 9am with 70 family members and 8 volunteers. Leaving cloudy Cambridge behind, the families spent a glorious day on the beach, where it was warm enough for a paddle.

The programme continues with an afternoon of ten-pin bowling and will finish with a picnic at Coton on August Bank Holiday Monday.
