title:  Can you help pay for driving lessons?

We are launching a new fundraising campaign to pay for driving lessons for any of our refugee friends who have passed their theory test. We aim to buy a block of lessons from a Cambridge driving school, and will use these to give short courses to several different learners. Many of them are experienced drivers and will hopefully only need a little help with British practice to pass the practical test.

We would like to hear from anyone prepared our learners out on practice drives - you'll need a full UK driver's licence in addition to our usual other requirements.

If you can help financially, please [donate through our usual route](/donate) to support all our work, including this campaign.

The ability to drive is very useful in a refugee's search for long-term employment and we hope that, through this campaign, we'll be able to make a real difference to our friends.
