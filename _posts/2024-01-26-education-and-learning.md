CRRC's programme of supplying refurbished IT devices to refugees continues  and is open to all new arrivals. This family from Sudan were very pleased to receive laptops just before Christmas. We have also recently given laptops to an Afghan family whose older children are yet to be offered school places.

We are delighted to report that one Syrian mum has passed her driving test, while another has passed both her B1 English exam and her 'Life in the UK' test. Congratulations to both of them. Meanwhile, in Brampton, the weekly gathering of women from the Afghan families continues to be popular, with a full house most weeks. Normally held in the Methodist Church in Brampton, sometimes the group decamps to a nearby caf√©, where the women are encouraged to ask about the cakes on offer and order for themselves.

Finally, our warmest best wishes go to Hussain in his new post at the St Neots Neurological Centre. Hussain ran a successful medical practice in northern Afghanistan and has worked tirelessly, since settling locally with his family two years ago, to pass online medical courses to equip him to practise in the UK.
