Professor Gil Loescher's last work, *Refugees: A Very Short Introduction*, will be launched on 27 May. Published by Oxford University Press, Professor Loescher dedicated a chapter of his book to the work of civil society organisations, inspired by conversations with his daughter Maggie, who is a founder member of CRRC. We are honoured to be mentioned.

Please register to attend [here](https://carleton.ca/lerrn/cu-events/gil-loescher-book-launch/). Note that the event begins at 3pm UK time but is being hosted in Canada, so times advertised are EST.
