If you want to help Ukrainian refugees, please donate to aid groups such as [Hope and Aid Direct](https://www.hopeandaiddirect.org.uk/Appeal/ukraine) or the [International Red Cross](https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-crisis-appeal). Please do not collect material aid unless you have personal connections with a group in the region which has requested this. Please also [sign the petition asking the UK Government to assist Ukrainian refugees](https://www.change.org/p/borisjohnson-and-ukhomeoffice-help-ukrainian-refugees-helpukrainianrefugees).

We have a [tech-request form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAnWh8oTQzpmBWGxdUKOWrCF6_GBRjysPkTksFIhaipSjXgA/viewform) for refugees or their hosts to complete to request laptops, phones or SIM cards.

If you want to know more about the Homes for Ukraine scheme and how you can help, we have [some information on hosting Ukrainian refugees here]({% post_url 2022-04-14-homes-for-ukraine-scheme-notes %}).

If you need access to the Cambridge Foodbank, we can issue vouchers if you get in touch with us. Similarly, we can help with contact for Cambridge Re-Matching if you need it.
