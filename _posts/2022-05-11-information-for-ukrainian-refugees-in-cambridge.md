If you want to help Ukrainian refugees, please donate to aid groups such as [Hope and Aid Direct](https://www.hopeandaiddirect.org.uk/Appeal/ukraine) or the [International Red Cross](https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-crisis-appeal). Please do not collect material aid unless you have personal connections with a group in the region which has requested this. Please also [sign the petition asking the UK Government to assist Ukrainian refugees](https://www.change.org/p/borisjohnson-and-ukhomeoffice-help-ukrainian-refugees-helpukrainianrefugees).
