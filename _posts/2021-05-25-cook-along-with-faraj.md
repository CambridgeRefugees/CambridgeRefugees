After the very successful 'Cook along with Faraj' event, Faraj has agreed to do it again! We're not the only ones who were impressed by Faraj: [ITV were, too](https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2021-05-05/from-syrian-refugee-to-cambridge-business-owner-in-3-years)!

Faraj is a fantastic cook who's trained at Ottolenghi and at Honey & Co. He's also a Syrian refugee who came to Cambridge 5 years ago, and now has his own catering business. He's been sharing some of his love of cookery in evenings of cooking and chat, creating some of his favourite Syrian dishes and sharing his recipe and techniques.

If you'd like to join us for this fantastic event, you can [book your place on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cook-along-with-faraj-tickets-154078193023) and get the list of ingredients you'll need to have ready.
