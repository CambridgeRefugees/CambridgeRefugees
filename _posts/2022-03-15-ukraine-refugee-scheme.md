The UK Government has announced a scheme by which UK residents can sponsor Ukrainian refugees and provide a home. Details are sparse at best at this stage around important details like how sponsors will be vetted (guests will be traumatised women and children, so being a sponsor and host is not just providing accommodation). However, the Government's website to register as a sponsor is available and, if you're interested, please do take a look and register.
