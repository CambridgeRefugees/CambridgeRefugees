September saw our first refugee social for a year and a half. We were all excited to see everyone again, and both the September and October socials were very popular. To comply with the school's new Covid precautions, these were held outside but the weather was fabulous on both occasions. Some really delicious catering was provided by Faraj (pictured) and Anas in order to limit possible problems with bring-and-share dishes.

The socials organising team would really like some more help so please [contact Faye](mailto:admin@cambridgerefugees.org) to volunteer. It is very rewarding and a key element in welcoming and supporting refugees in our area.
