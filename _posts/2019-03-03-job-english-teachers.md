We are seeking enthusiastic and experienced English language teachers to work as part of team providing regular classes to adults. Most of the people we support are absolute beginners, so experience of teaching beginners would be an advantage. Sessions are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings (10-12) in Cambridge. We are looking for volunteers who can support running the sessions, or who can lead one to two weeks per term. You will be required to undergo an enhanced DBS check.

### The role involves:

- Working with a team of teachers to agree an overall scheme of work for the term
- Planning the sessions and preparing materials for the weeks you are leading
- Regularly communicating with other lead teachers to be informed of learners' progress and needs
- Guiding the other teachers supporting the class
