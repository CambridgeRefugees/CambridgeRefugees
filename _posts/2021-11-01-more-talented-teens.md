The talented teens in our beneficiary families continue to impress with their achievements. In September, Hawra and Ameera [won a national teen business and social enterprise award](https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/news/cambridge-sisters-launch-charity-for-child-refugees-in-memor-9216963/) to develop their idea of a website that provides peer-to-peer advice for young refugees like themselves.

Inspired by the welcome they received in Cambridge when they arrived in the UK from Iraq in 2018, they decided to create a resource, New Beginnings, that would provide similar support but tailored to newly arrived teenagers with a chat facility and the opportunity for schools to book a video call with the girls. The judges were very impressed and they beat 24 other teams to win.

Well done, Girls!
