The residents of Marmalade Lane Co-Housing kindly invited the Afghan families to use their beautiful community room for a social in May. The families were able to pick up some donated clothes, enjoy a meal and play table tennis. This was the second social especially for Afghans. On 3rd May, four of the Cambridge families went by coach to visit the Brampton group and spend the day getting to know each other. The Brampton families have been invited to visit Cambridge and join the summer picnic on Jesus Green.
