This year, World Refugee Day is 20 June, and there are a number of events happening in Cambridge to help us celebrate and learn.

At time of writing, we know of two events. First, there's a conference on 20 June itself. It's being advertised as:

> an engaging programme of research and public events including research panels and flash talks. Bringing together a diverse array of academics, activists and community members, this event is open to all. It engages with the diversity of refugee experiences in an effort to uphold refugee rights. Free and all welcome.

On Saturday 22 June, there's an event "Celebration, Arts, Refugees":

> A family day, with musical performances, ceramic arts, visual arts and films and documentaries. It engages with the diversity of refugee experiences in an effort to uphold refugee rights. This day is in celebration of and with those in exile. The event is free and all welcome (including children).
