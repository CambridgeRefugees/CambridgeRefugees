We are seeking several enthusiastic volunteers to help prepare refugees for the driving theory test. You do not need to be a qualified teacher for this role, but willing to help someone with limited knowledge of English navigate an unfamiliar test in a foreign language. Some refugees have driven overseas, some are new drivers. It will help if you are a driver and/or have undertaken the Driving Theory test yourself.

We expect that you would meet once a week for an hour over a period of several months. You will be required to undergo an enhanced DBS check.
