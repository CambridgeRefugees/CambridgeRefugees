Over the years, Kalamna has been providing Arabic language classes for refugee children of Arab heritage in Cambridge. Sadly,  CRRC has had to discontinue funding  as there are now so many other calls on our resources. Amazingly, however, our friends at Kalamna have undertaken to continue to offer these classes pro bono and are now asking the wider community to consider contributing towards their tuition fees. If you would like to help, please email hello@kalamna.org
Meanwhile, we have heard that one of our young people is now studying architecture at university and has just entered her second year, while another has been offered work teaching car mechanics. Well done to both.
