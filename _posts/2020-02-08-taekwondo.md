![Group of young people in taekwondo outfits](/images/2020-02-08-taekwondo.jpg){: .float-right} Martial Arts Uniting Lives (MAUL) contacted CRRC in early January to offer free taekwondo sessions to the refugee families at Queen Edith's Primary School. The classes are aimed at women and children, and take place twice per week. Two refugee families attended and thoroughly enjoyed the class. Thank you very much to Chief Instructor, Wendy, and children's instructors, Jenny and Fatima.
