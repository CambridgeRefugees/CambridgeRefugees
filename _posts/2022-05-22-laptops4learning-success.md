The Laptops4Learning campaign is working! We expect around 1500 Ukrainian refugees in the Cambridge area, most of whom need phones and SIM cards, and many also laptops. In only a few short weeks, Laptops4Learning have already got their first laptops to some of those who need them. But we still need lots more help. If your business is upgrading its devices and has old ones to dispose of, please consider putting them in touch with Laptops4Learning.
