## Can you help refugees with cycling?

We provide second-hand bikes and cycling support to refugee families and people in the asylum process, across Cambridgeshire. It’s fantastic work - a bike helps refugees to access job centres, employment, education, healthcare, shops, food banks and more. 

So far, we have provided over 100 bikes to adults and children. We are now looking for several volunteers to help us continue this work. 

Please get in touch if you have a keen interest in cycling, a few hours a month to spare, and would enjoy a role in any, or all, of these areas.

### 1 Bike co-ordinator

We need someone with basic admin/IT skills to:
- Be the point of contact for refugees who request a bike.
- Refer these bike requests onto our partner charity which refurbishes second hand bikes and delivers them directly to families – this involves collecting info from people (like height, cycling ability), filling online forma and organising a bike delivery date once every 4-6 weeks.

### 2 Bike maintenance

We also need people with bike maintenance skills to:

- Refurbish a couple of good quality second hand bikes a month, so we can donate them e.g. new cables, replace tyres, add mudguards and racks
- Help families to maintain their bikes – change an inner tube, lube a chain, replace the brake blocks.

### 3 Collecting and delivering bikes

And we need people with a car (and preferably a bike rack) to:

- Collect bikes from the kind people in Cambridgeshire who donate them, and deliver refurbished bikes to refugee families

### The small print

We ask for a minimum commitment of 6 months.

In return, you’ll get an opportunity to:

- Make a real and significant different to the lives of refugees.
- Develop your interest and skills in bikes and cycling.
- Meet a wonderful group of volunteers from the Cambridgeshire area.
