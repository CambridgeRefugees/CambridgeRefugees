We are very excited to announce that we will be resuming regular volunteer socials on the fourth Wednesday of each month at the Maypole on Portugal Place. The next one will be next Wednesday 24th June, from 7.30pm. Please let us know by email to *admin at cambridgerefugees.org* if you will be coming as numbers will be limited.

We hope to re-start Refugee Socials as soon as this is allowed indoors. We would love to hear from you if you would like to join the team planning and organising the socials, which are likely to be popular when they begin again.
