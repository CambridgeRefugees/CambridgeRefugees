CRRC's Trustees have been out and about raising awareness of refugee issues around the area. Sue, Adrian and Dan gave an illustrated talk at Comberton Village College in February, which was so well received that they have been invited to Shelford Library to give the same talk on 26 June. Dan was also involved in a panel discussion at Emmanuel College organised by SOS Children's Villages on 25 February, entitled *A Journey towards Safety? NGOs and the Refugee Experience*.
