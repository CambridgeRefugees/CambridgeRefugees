Our Tech for Ukraine project is run by Emil and Isobel, who have been kept very busy taking and checking orders for refurbished tech devices, organising deliveries by a committed team of volunteers, and liaising with our partners at Laptops4Learning. 

Emil has just confirmed that we've now supplied 500 devices, plus about 200 SIM cards! Well done everyone, and a huge "Thank you!" to those who've donated.

We've had grant funding from South Cambridgeshire District Council, Reach Community Solar Farm and Cambrige Rotary Club but still need more devices to refurbish in bulk from local businesses as demand now extends to Huntingdon. If you can help, please email [Laptops4Learning](mailto:info@laptops4learning.co.uk) or [us](mailto:admin@cambridgerefugees.org).

Our family support and DIY teams have also begun to work with Ukrainian families who are moving into their own accommodation. We are particularly grateful to Martin at The Besom, Histon, for sourcing and installing a carpet free of charge in a flat in Impington. This was a wonderful contribution towards settling in a newly arrived Ukrainian family. The DIY team were able to help with finding furniture and white goods.
