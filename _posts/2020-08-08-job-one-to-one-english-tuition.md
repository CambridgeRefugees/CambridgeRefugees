Our one-to-one English tutors work with individual children in a family, helping with their homework, monitoring their progress, and correcting their English. It is very rewarding, offering an opportunity to get to know the whole family and establish a valuable connection. You don't need to be a teacher, just enthusiastic and patient, and happy to have a DBS check.

We ask for a minimum commitment of six months.

All tutoring is currently online.

### We are looking for:

- An excellent level of literacy, and general education.
- Patience.
- Interest in working with children.
- An understanding of the national curriculum expectations would be useful but not essential.
- Willingness to provide brief quarterly progress reports to the Education Group.

### In return, youâ€™ll get an opportunity to:

- Develop your English tuition skills.
- Establish a valuable connection with a refugee family.
- Make a real and significant difference to the lives of refugees.
- Meet a wonderful and passionate group of volunteers from the Cambridge area.
