CRRC Trustees Sue Spencer, Dan Ellis and Catharine Walston were invited to introduce our workshop on refugees and resettlement to Year 10s at Comberton Village College in early December. Despite the time constraints, the workshop ran smoothly and the students engaged well with the subject. Best of all, the staff were happy to take over the activities and run them themselves, allowing the resources to be rolled out to the other schools in the academy trust.

Thank you to Silouani Craveiro for inviting us. If your local school would like to use these resources to help students better understand the issues around refugees and resettlement, please ask them to get in touch.
