It is very rewarding, offering an opportunity to get to know the whole family and establish a valuable connection.

We ask for a minimum commitment of six months. A weekly commitment of an hour's teaching in the home is the norm.

An enhanced DBS check is necessary for this role. Further information can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).

### In return, youâ€™ll get an opportunity to:
