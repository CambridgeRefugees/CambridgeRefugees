After the successful trip to Hunstanton at the end of July, the Activities Team booked an afternoon of ten-pin bowling at the Cambridge Leisure Centre, which proved very popular with some of the dads, able to showcase their bowling expertise for the children. The Coton Village Fair on Bank Holiday Monday offered the opportunity for some bargain-hunting on the bric-a-brac stalls, as well as a picnic and a game of cricket on the recreation ground. About 50 people attended the picnic and we were very pleased that our newest arrivals came to both the bowling and the picnic. We were also delighted to be able to introduce a representative, Gareth, from Cambridgeshire Community Foundation to our work and some of our beneficiaries. We are very grateful to CCF for facilitating our summer programme with grant funding.
