Refugee week is approaching as it does every year. This year, it's 20-26 June and, although it's still a way off, we're getting our first announcements of events.

On Friday 17 June, [Norfolk Schools of Sanctuary](https://www.norfolksos.co.uk) are organising a Day of Welcome - a day of solidarity and learning in schools that aims to build a culture of welcome and understanding for refugees and asylum seekers.

> The celebration is designed to support schools and families in marking Refugee Week (20-26th June) and to send a clear message that our communities are welcoming places for those in need of sanctuary.
>
> Everyone is welcome to join in with A Day of Welcome! Regardless of where you are in the UK, we will provide you with ideas, resources and activities that make it easy for schools and families to participate, both in school and at home. We will also be providing additional resources specifically designed to share little-known local histories of refugee migration, for participating schools in Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Essex.
>
> If you are interested in participating in A Day of Welcome, please sign up via [our website](https://www.norfolksos.co.uk) or [email us to find out more](mailto://info@norfolksos.org).
