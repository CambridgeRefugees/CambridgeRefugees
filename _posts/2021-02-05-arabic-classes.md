All the children taking the Kalamna Arabic classes will be moving up a grade this term. The more advanced learners are already tackling GCSE preparation grammar resources and learning to discuss topics such as family, jobs and food. The beginners have begun to be able to read and write short key words in Arabic. Attendance has been very good despite the difficulties of online learning.
