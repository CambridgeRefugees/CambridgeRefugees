With children back at school and many places of work open, all of us are in contact with more people. We want you to be safe, well and able to enjoy others’ company in these difficult times, while taking actions that ensure that we don’t catch or spread the virus.

Since it is difficult to keep up with the rules on meeting others, we suggest that you use the following websites to find out the latest:

-	[Doctors of the World](https://www.doctorsoftheworld.org.uk/coronavirus-information/) has advice in a range of languages;
-	[The NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/.)

Please rely on the official sources for up to date guidance. Based on what we know now, we offer the following advice for situations when you physically meet others: **FACE, HANDS, SPACE**

-	Keep your distance! The advice continues to suggest we keep 2 metres apart and this is *essential* if masks are removed.  When outside in the fresh air *and* keeping 2m apart from each other, removing masks is more acceptable.
-	Wear a face mask, indoors or outside, unless you are within your household or outside *and* well separated from others by at least 2 metres.
-	Keep your hands clean and away from your face, especially your mouth; use sanitiser before and after meeting others, especially if you exchange any items.

If you have a fever, sore throat, a cough, headache, or shortness of breathe, be aware  these are symptoms of Covid 19. Follow NHS guidance on what to do next by checking online or ringing the helpline on 119. Do NOT meet others, isolate yourself at home and ask your fellow inhabitants to do the same.  

Keep safe and well!
