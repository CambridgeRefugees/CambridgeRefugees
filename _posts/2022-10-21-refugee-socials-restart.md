After a break for the summer holidays and with a new team supported by some experienced members, our regular refugee socials are back. We held our first of the school year in early October. It ran smoothly with ten families attending, all bringing some delicious dishes to share. Children's activities were organised and some useful conversations between parents and vounteers went on over a cup of tea. If you would like to volunteer to help at the socials or to join the planning team, please contact us for full details. The next social will be in mid-November and these are by invitation only.
