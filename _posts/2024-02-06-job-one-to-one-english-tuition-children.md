Our one-to-one English tutors work with individual children in a family, helping with their homework, tutoring GCSEs in core subjects, monitoring their progress, and improving their English. It is very rewarding, offering an opportunity to get to know the whole family and establish a valuable connection.

We ask for a minimum commitment of six months. A weekly commitment of an hour's teaching in the home is the norm.

An enhanced DBS check is necessary for this role. Further information can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).

### We are looking for:

- A recognised ESOL qualification.
- Patience.
- Interest in working with children.
- An understanding of the national curriculum expectations would be useful but not essential.
- Willingness to provide brief quarterly progress reports to the Education Group.

### In return, youâ€™ll get an opportunity to:

- Develop your English tuition skills.
- Establish a valuable connection with a refugee family.
- Make a real and significant difference to the lives of refugees.
- Meet a wonderful and passionate group of volunteers from the Cambridge area.
