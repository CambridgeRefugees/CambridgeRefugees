The Bike Project, our partner charity in South London, delivered 26 refurbished bikes to the families on 5th August and a further 15 the following week. We are very grateful to Amanda (pictured, with Lavri and his new bike) for setting this up, also for driving an hour and a half to collect a bike from the only Halfords which had a small menâ€™s bike! Outspoken, who provide cycling road safety courses to schools, has a backlog for school training but we hope to be able to book training sessions with them for groups of children soon.
