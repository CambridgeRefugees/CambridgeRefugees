When CRRC was first established in 2015, the organisation benefitted from some extremely generous gifts from individuals and groups. We have continued to receive kind donations but the ongoing complex needs of our beneficiaries and of potential new families will necessitate more sustained fundraising in the future. We would very much like to hear from anyone who has experience of researching and applying for grants.
