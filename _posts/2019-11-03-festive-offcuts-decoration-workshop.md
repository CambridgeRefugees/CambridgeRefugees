Fellow local refugee-supporting charity [CamCRAG](http://camcrag.org.uk/) is running a free craft workshop making Christmas tree decorations out of fabric offcuts. The decorations will be sold to raise funds for CamCRAG's Poncho Project at Mill Rd Winter Fair, although participants will be given patterns and any surplus to keep. No sewing skills or materials required!

The workshop will take place between 10am and 4pm at Friends' Meeting House (12 Jesus Lane).  For more information, please see [the event page](http://camcrag.org.uk/event/festive-offcuts-decoration-workshop/) or [email CamCRAG](ponchos@camcrag.org.uk).
