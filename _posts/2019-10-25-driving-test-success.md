![Car key and learner plates](/images/2019-10-25-driving-test-success.jpg){: .float-right} Ahmed, who is just starting university and is the eldest child of one of our beneficiary families, recently became the first member of any of Cambridge's resettled refugee families to pass his UK driving test. Many congratulations, Ahmed!

Several others have now sat and passed their theory tests, although the language barrier is still a major hurdle for many, but we are hoping for some more successes soon.
