We are seeking enthusiastic and qualified English language teachers to work as part of team providing regular classes to adults. Most of the people we support are absolute beginners, so experience of teaching beginners would be an advantage. Sessions are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings (10am-12pm) in Cambridge during school terms. We are looking for volunteers who can teach once a week or fortnight, working with a lead teacher who determines and prepares the lesson content.  You will be required to undergo an enhanced DBS check.

### The role involves:

- Working with a team of teachers to agree an overall scheme of work for the term
- Working with individual learners in a class setting
- Regularly communicating with other teachers with regard to learners’ progress and needs

### In return, you’ll get an opportunity to:

- Meet a wonderful and passionate group of volunteers from the Cambridge area
- Make a real and significant difference to the lives of refugees
