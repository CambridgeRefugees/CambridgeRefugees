We would like to express our deepest gratitude to Synaptics, a 'Silicon Fen' chip-design company based on the Trinity Science Park, which has generously donated 25 newly cleaned computers for the refugee families to use. These were collected by our new IT coordinator, Paula. The Trustees would like to thank Synaptics for this very generous gift, which will make a tremendous difference to the lives of our beneficiaries.

We're also immensely grateful to The Cambridge Community Kitchen, which has provided cooked vegan meals for some of our families, and to The Arts Theatre for offering volunteer work experience opportunities to refugee families.
