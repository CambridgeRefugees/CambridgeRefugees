CRRC recognises that all refugees have experienced considerable trauma and may continue to do so even once housed and set up in the UK.

To address this, CRRC trustee and psychologist Ann Goodridge and Susan Mealing of the Refugee Council have designed a half-day workshop to help volunteers interpret what they observe in the refugee families so that they can better respond appropriately. It is also to help our volunteers to build their own resilience from that better understanding and by applying some of the hints and tips to themselves.

So far we have run one session and are planning more, and we are currently reviewing this and exploring how we might improve it and broaden its application among our volunteers, with the ultimate aim of better supporting the families.

Anyone interested or who wants more information or to offer ideas please [contact us](/contact) and let us know.
