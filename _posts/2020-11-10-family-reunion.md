Safe, legal routes to resettlement are needed to prevent people desperate to be reunited with friends and family taking sometimes fatal risks to reach the UK. This is why it is so important to campaign for the legal resettlement of refugees to be re-started.

CRRC has found that this is possible even in the present situation as a family from a camp in Jordan arrived in October to be reunited with their father and uncle in Cambridge. We were able even more recently to welcome three members of another family who had been separated for more than a decade by conflict. We were privileged to assist in a wonderful reunion after visas were finally granted and the family members were able to cross the border from Gaza to Egypt and fly from there to the UK. They are now in quarantine and being supported by their family and CRRC volunteers.

This is how all such journeys should end.
