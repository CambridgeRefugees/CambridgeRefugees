We are seeking help with the running of our monthly socials. The CRRC Socials are the backbone of our work here in Cambridge and have been running for almost four years. It is a monthly opportunity for beneficiary families to come together to share time and food and to meet volunteers. It is also where a lot of CRRC business gets done.

### This role involves:
- Commitment to most Saturday socials (taking place one Saturday a month) for at least one year.
- Willingness to sign up to the doodle poll.
- Two to three hours of work on the day of the social.
- DBS checks through CRRC are essential.

### The jobs below are shared amongst the volunteers and you can choose what you would like to sign up for:
- Serving drinks and food.
- cleaning up in the kitchen and using the dishwasher.
- Setting up and clearing away tables and chairs.
- Hoovering.
- Helping with craft, games and sports in the children’s room.
- Being First-Aider (training necessary).
- Being safety warden (managing spaces and helping keep children safe).
- Helping with meeting and greeting attendees (Arabic very helpful).
- Adhering to safety policies.
- Passing on any questions and concerns during the socials to CRRC Trustees or the organising committee present.

### Attributes required
- Excellent communication and organisational skills.
- Ability to work as part of a team and delegate tasks.
- Flexibility.
- With the occasional exception, availability one Saturday per month.

### In return, you’ll get the opportunity to:
- Meet a wonderful and passionate group of volunteers from the Cambridge area.
- Make a real and significant difference to the lives of refugees.
