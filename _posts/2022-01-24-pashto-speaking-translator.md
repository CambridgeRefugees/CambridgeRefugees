We are looking for someone able to provide occasional translation services for the small group of Afghan families resettled in Cambridgeshire. You do not need to be a professional translator but you will need excellent English and Pashto. The existing resettled families have reached the UK under the ARAP scheme as people who worked for the British Forces in Afghanistan. At least one family member, therefore, already has a reasonably good level of English. There are, however, misunderstandings and few of the women speak English; these are the areas where we need assistance.

At present, this role is likely to be virtual but we would expect face-to-face contact in the future.

All volunteers are DBS checked. Further information can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).

### The role specifically involves:

- Translation to and from Pashto.
- Speaking to members several refugee families by video (for now, at least).
- Gaining the confidence of the families and speaking to refugee women.
- Working as part of a team to make sure we help our families.

### Skills required:

- Excellent spoken English and Pashto.
- Comfortable using video calls (including having access to a device).
- Excellent general communication skills.
- Comfortable working as part of a team.
- Experience working in a similar environment or role would be ideal but is not essential.

### In return, youâ€™ll get an opportunity to:

- Have a front-line opportunity to help refugees settle in and make a positive contribution to their ongoing welfare.
- Develop your organizational and communication skills.
- Work with a wonderful and passionate group of volunteers from the Cambridge area.
- Make a real and significant difference to the lives of refugees
