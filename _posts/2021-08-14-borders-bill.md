The Nationality and Borders Bill, which seeks to overhaul the asylum system, making it even more difficult for people to settle here, had its second reading at the end of July. Disappointingly, it passed by over 100 votes but the fight goes on. The Bill moves to the committee stage after the summer recess so there is still plenty of time to lobby your MP.

The Bill is an attack on our traditions of sanctuary and flouts our responsibilities under international law. You will find a template letter [here]({% link npfi-2021.md %}) as well as links to responses from groups with experience of the asylum sector, explaining what is wrong with the Bill.
