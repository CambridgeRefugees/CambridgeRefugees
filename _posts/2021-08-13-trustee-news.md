![Marya, our new Trustee](/images/2021-08-13-trustee-news.jpg){: .float-right }

This month we welcomed a new member of our Board of Trustees. Many volunteers will already have met Marya, as she acts as a family focal point and, together with her husband Shwan, has been very active in supporting refugee families. Marya herself is a refugee from Kurdistan, who was displaced from Halabja as a child and then again with her family as an adult. We are very pleased to welcome her.

Very sadly, our Chair, Dan, was recently diagnosed with a serious illness, which means that he and Amy will be stepping back for what we hope will be a short break. In the meantime, Deputy Chair Ann will be taking on chairing responsibilities. We would love to hear from any volunteers who would like to join the family support team to help Adrian and Samir.
