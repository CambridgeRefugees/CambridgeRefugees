There are three Afghan families resettled in the Cambridge area so far, with another four expected before Christmas. They are being very well supported with friendship and donations of clothing and furniture by their local community, and visited regularly by CRRC volunteers.

CRRC is working to ensure a smooth entry into the school system and additional language support for the children and their mothers, as well as offering bicycles and learning resources. The families are all here on the ARAP scheme for Afghans who worked for the British Armed Forces. The men are skilled and speak some English, so should be able to find work as soon as their families are properly settled in.

So far, however, the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme announced at the end of the summer has not materialised.
