![View from inside a car, of a person with their hands on the steering wheel](/images/2020-02-01-driving-test-campaign.jpg){: .float-right} CRRC were delighted to be consulted by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) via the Strategic Migration Partnership about the challenges that refugees can face in taking the driving theory test. The DVSA are also exploring ways to simplify the Highway Code and will improve the accessibility of the theory test for all test candidates, including refugees. DVSA have asked for our input to ensure the refugee perspective is considered in the Highway Code review.

We're delighted with the success of this campaign, which follows our celebrations with Amira when, in November, she became the first of the refugee women to pass her driving theory test. Having never driven before, she was then able to start lessons on the road and work towards driving independently for the first time!
