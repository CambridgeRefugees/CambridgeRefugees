We have received a £5000 grant from the Cambridgeshire Community Foundation's Warwick and Dominey Fund. This will support all our core activities, and so help provide English lessons for adult refugees, after-school activities for the refugee children, such as Code Club and Arabic classes, and holiday outings for entire refugee families. We are very grateful for their generosity to the families we help.
