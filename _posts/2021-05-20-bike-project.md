A side effect of the pandemic is that there are huge global supply problems. New bikes are very difficult to buy at the moment and, as a result, secondhand bikes have dramatically increased in price.

However, Amanda, our Bike Project coordinator (on the left in the first picture, with Lavri from Sudan), has managed to source several bikes for the refugee families, including two brand new ones for two of the boys to cycle to school and this lovely blue one for Salma (pictured below). Amanda is also booking tailored training with Outspoken, and has partnered with a London-based charity which refurbishes bikes.
