This year, World Refugee Day is 20 June, and there are a number of events happening in Cambridge to help us celebrate and learn.

On Sunday 30 June at the Cambridge Corn Exchange, from 4-5:30pm, there is a free concert in support of refugees. The concert is hosted by Michael Rosen, alongside choirs, poets, musicians, dance groups and more, from across Cambridge.
