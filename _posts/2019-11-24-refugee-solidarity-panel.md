## Panel Discussion hosted by RE:action
### Keynes Hall, King's College, 6-7.30pm

Join us for a panel discussion with two amazing NGOs - Refugee Community Kitchen and Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign.

We will be giving an update about current conditions facing displaced people in Northern France, and what work is like for humanitarian groups on the ground there. We will also discuss the challenges that face people who are resettling in the UK, and the work that CRRC do to support them in that transition.

Our main focus will be on the concept of solidarity - what does it really mean, and what are some different ways that you can show solidarity and get involved in active solidarity work to support refugee and migrant communities?
