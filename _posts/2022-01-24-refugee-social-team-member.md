The team in charge of organising our monthly refugee socials would love to welcome some new members. Held at a local school, the socials are usually very well attended by both refugee families and invited volunteers, and require some logistical planning. This is a great opportunity for socialising with the refugee families, making friends and getting involved in the group.

All volunteers are DBS checked. Further information can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).

### Members of the team share responsibility for:

- sending out the invitations,
- keeping track of numbers,
- providing transport (booking taxis, organising car shares), and
- assigning jobs to helpers on the day (setting up, serving refreshments, children’s activities, clearing away).

### Skills required:

- You will need to be reliable and friendly but no experience is necessary.

### In return, you’ll get an opportunity to:

- Have a front-line opportunity to help refugees settle in and make a positive contribution to their ongoing welfare.
- Develop your organizational and communication skills
- Work with a wonderful and passionate group of volunteers from the Cambridge area
- Make a real and significant difference to the lives of refugees
