We were absolutely delighted to hear from Hend's family that she had been awarded the 2021 Hunt-Hereward Trophy for courage and loyalty by Soham Village College. This is a wonderful achievement as only three annual cups are awarded by the school, which Hend joined three and a half years ago speaking no English. We wish her the very best for her sixth form studies.
