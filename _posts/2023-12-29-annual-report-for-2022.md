## Structure, governance, and management

This is CRRC’s fifth report as a CIO, during which it was governed by between eight to
11 charity trustees at given times.

In July 2021, Dan Ellis, CRRC’s chair of many years and instrumental to many of CRRC’s
successes, suffered a very serious cancer diagnosis and subsequently had to step back
as chair. The team were delighted and very grateful that Dan has been able to continue
to be active as a trustee. Ann Goodridge took over as chair. Amy Ellis, Dan’s wife, who
had very actively been involved as a CRRC volunteer already, was welcomed as a
trustee in October 2021.

Marya Kakai resigned as a trustee in January 2022 and was very gratefully thanked for
her contribution. To our delight, she has continued as a CRRC volunteer.

The constitution provides for a minimum of five and a maximum of 12 trustees. Being
a Foundation CIO, the only voting members are its trustees. Trustees are appointed
for a term of three years by a resolution passed at a properly convened meeting of the
charity trustees. New trustees can be appointed by existing trustees. Any charity
trustee is eligible for reappointment and can serve for three consecutive terms.
Trustees commit to giving their time and expertise freely. No trustee remuneration
was paid during this period.

All relevant interests must be disclosed by trustees and registered with the other
trustees. In accordance with the charity’s best practice, a trustee must withdraw from
decisions where a conflict of interest arises. There were no such conflicts of interests
or decision withdrawals in this period.

During the reporting period, Trustees met at least bi-monthly in video or hybrid
meetings. Each meeting was chaired and minuted. Quorum for trustee meetings is
two charity trustees or the number nearest to one third of the total number of charity
trustees, whichever is greater. Actions, approvals, charity progress, accounts, and any
other business are reviewed in each meeting. Between meetings, trustees
communicate using email and WhatsApp. The trustees review the broad strategy and
areas of activity for the charity on a yearly basis.

## Volunteers and supporters

CRRC could not carry out its work without the tremendous contributions from its many
volunteers and supporters. CRRC works in a collaborative manner, recognising that
the nature of a volunteer-led group requires flexibility, whilst ensuring that it fulfils
tasks that it commits to within given time frames to achieve its objectives. The
organisation actively seeks and values volunteers from diverse backgrounds, life
experiences and perspectives.

There has been a high level of ongoing engagement from potential volunteers getting
in touch with CRRC to express their interest in being involved, suggesting that the
operational model is effective.

Between July 2021 and June 2022, 77 new volunteers have joined CRRC to take up a
range of roles. The team has completed basic and enhanced DBS checks for these
volunteers, in line with UK Government requirements and according to their role. At
the end of the financial year, CRRC had over 150 active volunteers, as well as 165
excellent applicants waiting for potential opportunities. The huge number of
volunteer hours provided, and level of enthusiasm and dedication shown by our
volunteers form a vital part of the CRRC community.

> Our heartfelt thanks to all volunteers and supporters of CRRC for their commitment and tremendous contributions to CRRC’s work!

Regular monthly volunteer social gatherings for existing volunteers, continued in
2021-22 and restarted as in-person meetings again following the lifting of COVID-19
restrictions These sessions allowed volunteers to exchange thoughts and ideas, and
to introduce new prospective volunteers to understand their potential role prior to
signing up.

## Beneficiaries

### Who benefits from CRRC's activities?

- Refugees settling or resettled by the Local Authority predominantly in Cambridge and Cambridgeshire benefit by being assisted in their settling in process and integration into the community.
- Local communities, including community and faith-based groups into which refugees are settling or being resettled, profit by fostering and promoting diversity and social cohesion.
- Relevant statutory authorities, politicians, and others involved in policy-making and decision-making on issues affecting refugees benefit by being supported in the delivery of their statutory functions.

CRRC accepts referrals from refugees themselves or from other individuals,
organisations or authorities, and considers whether assistance sought is consistent
with the organisation’s mandate and scope. Decisions on providing assistance are
made at quorate meetings of the trustees or as otherwise permitted by the
constitution. The trustees have regular meetings, where decisions are tabled at an
open discussion. There is also the opportunity for suggestions to be submitted within
our online group forum. Once decisions have been submitted, the trustees discuss and
then vote for the preferred option. The trustees discuss and adapt to changing local
and national circumstances and the needs of the beneficiaries.

## Objectives and activities for public benefit

### The charity's objectives

Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign (CRRC) is constituted for the following
purposes:

1. To promote any charitable purpose for the benefit of persons who have become displaced persons or refugees from the countries of their origin or domicile by reason of hostilities, persecution, oppression, discrimination, natural disasters or other like causes, including through the relief of poverty, the advancement of education and training, and the promotion of good citizenship.

1. To advance the education of the public in general about issues relating to persons who have become displaced persons or refugees from the countries of their origin or domicile by reason of hostilities, persecution, oppression, discrimination, natural disasters or other like causes.

### The charity's main activities

CRRC provides a range of practical support to refugees and liaises with local
stakeholders. CRRC works closely with county councils, district councils, city
councils, local charities, and other organisations that support and campaign
around refugee issues and enables the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer
to support refugees.

- provides welcome packs and secures household necessities for refugees.
- provides emergency grants to local refugees who are experiencing severe hardship, a disaster or emergency.
- facilitates and provides language tuition and interpreting services to refugees.
- assists refugees to develop employability skills and works with local
- employers to identify appropriate vacancies and other opportunities.
- provides funds to refugees for participation in community-based social activities and for educational purposes.
- helps to identify, secure and prepare accommodation for refugees.
- organises social events for refugees and CRRC’s volunteers.
- explores fostering opportunities and other forms of support for unaccompanied refugee children.
- informs faith-based groups, community groups, politicians and other organisations and individuals where appropriate about the situation of refugees and involves them in CRRC’s projects.
- organises and co-organises fundraising events.

### Benefits

In setting CRRC’s objectives and planning our activities, the trustees have given due
consideration to the Charity Commission’s general guidance on public benefit:
By supporting and promoting the welfare and inclusion of all refugees predominantly
in Cambridge and Cambridgeshire, there is a public benefit to refugees, the local
communities and stakeholders in creating a welcoming and safe environment for
refugees.

CRRC achieves this by providing a range of practical support (including providing
welcome packs and household necessities to refugees), organising social events for
the refugees, CRRC volunteers and the local communities, and securing and preparing
accommodation.

By supporting refugees to adapt to their new environment, the local communities
benefit from refugees’ contributions and involvement in the local community,
whether by way of employment or social cohesion etc. In addition to the examples
provided above, CRRC assists refugees to develop employability skills and works with
local employers to identify appropriate opportunities.

By providing practical support to local authorities in accommodating refugees, both
benefit from CRRC’s assistance in overcoming logistical and economic challenges
(among others) that can be experienced in the process of settling in. CRRC provides
this assistance by, as mentioned above, securing accommodation for refugees and
fostering opportunities and other forms of support for unaccompanied refugee
children.

By publicising and celebrating the contribution of refugees to local communities, UK
society and culture, refugees, local communities and the public at large benefit from
embracing diversity, and challenging hostility and discrimination in society. CRRC
achieves this by organising social, advocacy and fundraising events for refugees, local
communities and volunteers. These activities help inform faith-based organisations,
and community groups and other advocacy bodies on the plight of refugees and their
contributions to UK society.

## Risk management

In 2021-2022, the trustees have considered the major risks to which the charity was
exposed, have reviewed, and monitored them and put in place mitigation steps. The
main risks that trustees identified during this period were:

### External environment

The hardship faced by CRRC’s beneficiaries have been exacerbated by changes to the
benefits system, the general cost of living crisis in the UK and misunderstandings
about their responsibilities as benefits claimants.

Some beneficiaries have suffered from hostility toward refugees or to their religion in
their locality. The lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has posed multiple
challenges to our beneficiaries and has put pressure (in terms of time, commitment,
and opportunity for face-to-face contact) on beneficiaries and volunteers working
closely with the families. The organisation has worked to mitigate the impact of these
challenges by assisting families and signposting them to relevant information and
practical support. Where necessary, the organisation has provided emergency in-kind
and financial support and encouraged our beneficiaries and volunteers to adjust to
changes by taking advice early.


### Financial security of CRRC

The ability to continue CRRC’s work relies on monetary donations and donations in
kind from groups and individuals. The organisation encourages charitable giving from
the local community through social media, fundraising events, and general promotion
activities. Where appropriate, GiftAid for donations (when from individuals) is
collected. In the event of a significant donation (over £10,000), CRRC will request the
individuals’/companies’ address details and undertake due diligence checks to satisfy
the trustees as to the source of the donations and ensure that the prospective gift is
aligned with the charity’s objectives. Most payments are by cash, cheque or bank
transfer. There have been no concerns to date in relation to public donations, and a
full income and expenditure database has been maintained. Donors’ names are
acknowledged in our external communications and accounts with the consent of the
donor.

### Operational risks

CRRC carries out risk assessments for all activities to ensure that risks are understood,
and policies and procedures are then put in place to mitigate these. CRRC has
continued to review and update policies and procedures around some key risk areas
including safeguarding and Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks.

## Achievements and performance

CRRC’s activities in the year July 2021 to June 2022. (Some adjustments were required to the in-person activities during the Covid-19 pandemic.)

### Support for families and individuals

#### Who did CRRC support over the reporting period?

By the end of the previous reporting period (June 2021), CRRC had supported 25
families being resettled under the UK Government’s VPRS scheme in addition to a
further 8 individuals or families arriving via other routes some of whom were asylum
seekers. Government resettlement under VPRS ceased from March 2020 for the
duration of the pandemic and its successor scheme, UKRS, has only partially been
opened. Within the current reporting period, CRRC welcomed only one further VPRS
family (in July 2021 as lockdown restrictions ended) - a ‘residual’ family originally from
Sudan who had been due to be resettled before the pandemic arrived.

On 15 August 2021, Kabul fell to the Taliban, leading to the exodus of many Afghan
families to the UK, many of whom had worked directly or indirectly with the British
military forces in Afghanistan or at the British Embassy there or were linked to the
political opposition. Others were British citizens of Afghan descent who had a right to
bring their immediate family to the UK.

#### Refugee resettlement from Afghanistan across Cambridgeshire

By the end of June 2022 across Cambridgeshire, 14 new Afghan families had been
resettled, some in Cambridge City or South Cambridgeshire and some in the
Huntingdon District Council area of the county. The relative distance from Cambridge
of the ‘Huntingdon’ group of beneficiary families meant that new partnership working
was developed with local groups in the north of the county to support these new
arrivals.

In October 2021, three Afghan families were re-housed in 'in former MOD
accommodation near Huntingdon'. They had all been evacuated from Kabul under the
ARAP scheme. Two more Afghan families were resettled in January and March 2022,
via ARAP. In February 2022, Huntingdon District Council (HDC) re-housed two Afghan
families in Housing Association homes on the outskirts of the town. By June 2022,
there were seven families in the area (a total of 41 people).

From the time of the first arrivals, CRRC worked closely with a local community group,
Brampton Hub, to help the families resettle, providing welcome packs, clothing,
household items, laptops, and TVs etc. They were assisted with school and GP
registration and job seeking requirements and familiarised with the local area
(including shops and the library). With CRRC support, outings were arranged (including
one to London in March) and a weekly English Conversation Group was set up for the
women in a Methodist Church (venue provided free of charge). With the two
Huntingdon families, the resettlement support was provided almost entirely by CRRC. For all families, CRRC has worked closely with the Peterborough Asylum and Refugee
Community Association (PARCA) on issues related to training, employment, and
English lessons. The group also attended council-funded English lessons at the
Huntingdon library. Although all the men had been translators with the British Army
and/or worked in the British Embassy in Kabul, in most cases their English was not
good enough to seek work in the sectors they had worked in (e.g., pharmacy,
firefighting, administration, business), so this will be a focus of future CRRC support.
In five of the families, CRRC funded driving lessons for beneficiaries.

#### Christmas 2021

Some of the children in the three Afghan families who arrived in Brampton in
September/October 2021 expressed interest in having a Christmas tree. What did the
parents think? Might this go against religious beliefs? Not a bit of it, said all the
parents. So, we (CRRC and a volunteer from the Brampton Hub community group)
went to the local garden centre to ask if they would donate some small Christmas
trees. How many, they asked. Three? Sure. We went back to collect the trees a week
later. And there they were - not small at all, and each of them not only with their own
tree stand but also with box of decorations! Dressed in Father Christmas hats and
singing carols we duly delivered the trees, and they made a splendid addition to the
families’ first Christmas in the UK.

> With Brampton Hub help, as well as the local Anglican church, CRRC arranged a cultural awareness talk for all volunteers in the area working with the newly arrived refugee families.
>
> By the time of the talk - on 26 February 2021 – there were seven families in the Huntingdon/Brampton area. The talk was given by a volunteer with PARCA whose family came from the Hazara community in Afghanistan. We also asked two of the men in the families if they would give a short talk. One spoke of his journey here after the fall of Kabul – a harrowing experience that included being flown out with a two-day-old baby. The other spoke about his experiences since arriving in the UK, from a hotel in Milton Keynes to a house in Brampton , the difficulties of adjustment, the relief of seeing his family in a safe place and the gratitude for what had been provided to help them settle.
>
> The audience learned a great deal, not least on the etiquette front. It is, for example, just not on to visit an Afghan house without drinking copious amount of chai or green tea, accompanied by nuts, cakes and sweets, whatever the time of day – there has, as a result, been a noticeable expansion of volunteers’ waistlines.

Overall, by mid-2022, these families were all settling in well, with one family experiencing great challenges. A persistent rodent infestation in one of the Huntingdon houses caused the family considerable distress and they requested to be re-housed but, backed by HDC, CRRC worked with the relevant housing association to resolve the problem and the family was able to start settling down. With no exceptions, the families are all very keen to re-build their lives in the UK.

#### Refugees and asylum seekers arriving outside of the resettlement routes

In addition to continuing support to families that had arrived through VPRS and
beginning to support those arriving under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance
Policy (ARAP), CRRC began to see an increase in referrals for help or assistance from
other local organisations. These organisations included the single homelessness
service, Refugee Education UK, and the BACA charity which works with
unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and care leavers. These beneficiaries came
from a wide range of countries including Ethiopia, Palestine, Yemen, and Libya – the
referrals from Refugee Education UK and BACA were unaccompanied children or care
leavers.

In addition, from March 2022, CRRC began to see the arrival of Ukrainian families
fleeing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (see below for CRRC’s response).

#### Refugees seeking support following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, significant numbers of
Ukrainians fled the country. The refugees were mainly women, children, and older
people with most men of working age remaining to join the Ukraine Army. On 4 March
2022, the UK Government launched the Ukraine Extended Family Scheme allowing
Ukrainians who had family members settled in the UK to join them. There was no
requirement for the UK-based family member to accommodate their relatives in their
home and, where they could not do so, the housing duty fell to the Local Authority in
which the sponsoring family member lived. This meant there was a need to find
accommodation for some families arriving under this scheme.

Under public pressure to do more, the Homes for Ukraine scheme was announced on
14 March 2022 allowing UK residents to host Ukrainian families in their own homes.
Both schemes were to be operated through local authorities. UK residents offering to
host Ukrainian ‘guests’ needed to register their interest on a government website and
arrange a match with a Ukrainian family seeking safety in the UK.

Following the launch of the scheme, CRRC started to receive enquiries from people
wishing to host Ukrainian refugee families and from Ukrainians seeking to come to the
Cambridge area. The team advised both potential hosts and guests how they could
sign up for this scheme through the government website, and then find trusted
matching brokers through a safe list of organisations that CRRC knew provided a
matching service.

### The family support team structure

Between July 2021 and June 2022, the family support team grew from four core
members to five, with one member stepping back and two new members joining the
team, one as administrative support, and one to oversee the newly arrived Afghan
families in and around Huntingdon.

Over the year the team of recruited volunteer focal points expanded significantly from
17 active focal points to 36 with a total of 26 new recruits joining CRRC and 7 focal
points leaving. The reasons for people leaving were that the recipient family had
moved location, or the focal points were relocating themselves. Members of the core
family support team are involved in recruitment of volunteers, and they work
alongside the administration team to ensure that interviews are carried out and that
DBS processes are begun and completed.

In May 2022, a focal point training event was held with Syrian food provided by one
of the CRRC beneficiaries who runs a professional catering service. There were 35
attendees with stimulating talks by existing focal points and a presentation on energy
company grants and reductions.

Of the 36 active focal points, 13 individuals oversee individual families, one oversees
several Arabic-speaking families, (this person is a core member of the family support
team) 8 focal points work in pairs, 9 focal points work in teams of 3 and four focal
points form one team of four. Teams are necessary where the needs of the recipient
family remain high, usually due to considerable emotional and/or physical challenges.
Five focal point teams include a native Arabic speaker, often where the recipient
family is either illiterate or finds learning English especially hard.

Focal points all provide practical and emotional support to their recipient families and
relay relevant information or requests through the family support group. Focal points
are asked to submit a summary of their actions at the end of each month. Requests
are then either dealt with directly by family support team members (Doula support,
transport assistance, translation assistance, indefinite-leave-to-remain support,
benefit support, housing support) or passed onto the relevant specialised team, be it
donations, IT, gardening, DIY, bikes, driving, education, Cambridge Ethnic Community
Forum (CECF) and Cambridge Advisory Bureau (CAB).

In addition to new focal points, this year additional key volunteers were recruited to
carry out the day-to-day work of the family support group and CRRC. This included a
new donations coordinator, donations garage organiser, a new DIY team and a new IT
coordinator. A new CRRC Team Ukraine was established to meet the needs of new
beneficiaries from Ukraine.

### Health and welfare support

Focal points often assist with health and welfare concerns of recipient families. CRRC
provided welcome packs of food supplies and bedding for the new tranche of Afghan
families arriving. Focal points liaised with families and helped them purchase school
uniforms for the children as well as new shoes, school bags and PE kits.

Focal points have helped several families deal with serious medical needs and
disabilities, including help with PIP payments. Volunteers have driven many recipients
to hospitals and medical appointments, sometimes at considerable distance from
Cambridge, to undergo necessary medical procedures.

Core members of the family support team participated in child safeguarding meetings
alongside assigned social and family workers to support a vulnerable family. Another
family received practical and legal support and advice on how to navigate housing and
legal status within the UK. An art therapist employed by the Refugee Council run
regular well-being art sessions for some vulnerable families.

CRRC provides emergency hardship grants to local refugees who experience severe
hardship or an emergency. This type of support is intended as a short-term solution
rather than a long-term financial commitment. The application process for a hardship
grant is overseen by the trustees and follows the emergency hardship grant policy.
One emergency hardship grant was provided in the reporting period for a newly
arrived Afghan family whose benefits had been delayed.

CRRC acts as a distributor of vouchers for the Cambridge Food Bank for beneficiaries
in especially difficult circumstances. A designated volunteer was recruited from May
2022 to issue online food bank vouchers and CRRC has issued nine vouchers from May
to June 2022. The One Hope Foundation provided emergency food packages to 10
families struggling with the cost of living.

In response to messages of concern from families and focal points, a volunteer was
recruited to create documents on household energy usage and grants available to
assist with increasing costs. These were translated by volunteers into Arabic and Farsi.
Focal points helped families apply for financial assistance if they were relevant.
Further informational material provided was on ways of identifying and acting upon
domestic violence for those experiencing domestic violence. One of the translators
who assisted CRRC is an Afghan refugee recently resettled into the UK.

### Doulas and medical visits

This year has seen the safe arrival of four babies to CRRC families. Two women
received support from a doula through an access fund, a charity, which was arranged
through the focal points and the family support team. CRRC gives a grant of £200 per
child to help the parents buy necessary items.

### Support for the home

#### Donations

This year, a new donations coordinator and garage coordinator were recruited to
supervise and sort the garage where donations are stored. In one month, they
provided: mirrors, toys, books, vacuum cleaners, buggies, bunk beds, TVs, barstools,
microwaves, clothes dryers, baby cots, sewing machines, sports equipment,
trampolines, bedding, coat stands, CD players, wardrobe, blankets, white board,
lampshades, coats, bikes, kids’ clothes, shoe racks.

We have received new handmade children’s quilts and purchased new mattress
toppers for several families.

#### DIY

A team of three was recruited including one volunteer with a van which was very
handy. From May 2022, the CRRC DIY team has helped with DIY jobs such as repairing
doors, hanging up mirrors, TVs, and curtain rails. They have fixed broken drawers and
wardrobes, installed a garden gate, repaired a bunk bed, and replaced a toilet seat.

##### Gardening project

During this period, the gardening group have visited and worked in the gardens of six
recently arrived families from Afghanistan. After an initial visit and discussion with
each family, basic gardening equipment was provided, according to need, and this
typically included a push-mower, a spade, a watering-can and a trowel. Seedlings
planted were generally plant potatoes, broad beans, climbing beans, tomatoes,
courgettes, herbs and flowers but also specific requests such as strawberry plants for
the children. Many of the families have been housed with large gardens needing
electric mowers which were donated or bought from Cambridge Free-cycle. Most of
the families helped the team in the garden. The team visited new Afghan families with
their focal point volunteer near Huntingdon to advise on garden maintenance.

The team was offered raspberry plants, rhubarb, and a fig tree which a Sudanese
family have planted in their vegetable patch in the back garden. All were thriving at
last visit.

The team continued to help with the gardens of two families in the city. This has
mostly involved mowing and clearing weeds plus providing seeds and seedlings.
Although the aim is for all families to become independent gardeners, this is unlikely
to happen while each of the parents have many other family challenges to manage.
The team were fortunate that all the volunteers are experienced and knowledgeable
gardeners who have been prepared to turn up and work on a regular basis.

#### IT support

Access to Information Technology (IT) such as laptops and phones is vital for adult
beneficiaries to communicate with friends and family, to engage with learning
providers and to access banking, government, council, children’s schools and other
services. Additionally, secondary school-age children need IT for online learning and
other school services/notifications - as well as for contacting friends and family. A
CRRC volunteer acts as IT coordinator to oversee the process.

In May 2022, CRRC surveyed beneficiaries to assess their IT needs. At the same time,
CRRC began working with Laptops4Learning (L4L), a local provider of recycled IT
equipment. CRRC also ran a campaign to collect donations of second-hand laptops and
smartphones donated at drop points in 3 local pubs. Via a mix of these, plus some
purchased second-hand equipment, around 25 Windows laptops and tablets were
provided to beneficiaries.

The team was also able to offer some limited repairs to IT equipment and user
support, with the aim of getting our beneficiaries back online wherever possible.

#### Tech support to arrivals from Ukraine

Our prior experience of working with refugee families alerted the team to the
importance of having access to a device for basic resettlement tasks. These tasks
include opening bank accounts, signing up for benefits, registering with a GP, enrolling
children in schools, seeking work, learning English, and communicating with friends
and family back at home. In addition, with the Ukrainian arrivals, it quickly became
apparent that children needed devices for accessing online education provided by
their schools in Ukraine and for schoolwork in the UK once they had found a school
place. The team had the ambitious target of aiming to provide for the IT needs of any
Ukrainian family arriving in Cambridge City or South and East Cambridgeshire District
Council areas.

To achieve this, the team partnered with the company L4L whose business model is
to take surplus IT devices from companies who are replenishing their stock and recycle
those devices for social good. In conjunction with L4L, the business community in and
around Cambridge were engaged and the team was reasonably successful in obtaining
laptops that could be refurbished and prepared ready for use with a Windows 10
operating system installed. Three pubs around Cambridge - The Haymakers, The
Champion of the Thames, and the Blue Ball Inn - offered to be collection points for
individuals wishing to donate surplus tech items.

These were then collected and passed on to L4L for refurbishment before being
returned for distribution to arriving families. CRRC also registered with Vodafone to
be distributors of the free SIM cards the company were offering for Ukrainians arriving
in the UK. Through our established relationships with the Refugee Council, Vodafone
also supplied 70 free mobile phone handsets at the end of June 2022.

In parallel with securing a supply of IT devices for distribution, CRRC set up a dedicated
CRRC Team Ukraine to administer requests for devices from families and to deliver
these, free of charge to their accommodation in the local authority where they were
being hosted. To publicise the service, a request form was provided to the three
district councils for advertising via their welcome packs and social media outreach.
This service was launched on 27 April 2022 and by the end of June 2022, there had
been over 200 requests from Ukrainian families asking for IT devices or SIM cards.

With demand for IT devices outstripping supply obtained through donations, by early
June 2022 the team had to consider grant funding to purchase refurbished devices to
supplement the donations. On 22 June 2022, CRRC received a grant of £10,000 from
South Cambridgeshire District Council to provide laptops and tablets for Ukrainian
families in their district being hosted under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. This was
enormously helpful in enabling the team to deliver devices requested in a timely
manner.

#### Accommodation queries/offers and sponsorship queries

During July 2021 and June 2022, 28 contacts were received through the website
regarding offers of and requests for refugee accommodation. From March 2022
onwards most of these related to the Ukrainians either seeking accommodation, or
local people offering accommodation.

Of the 27 approaches, seven were direct queries about how to sponsor, or how to find
a sponsor, through the Ukraine Family Scheme or through the Homes for Ukraine
scheme. The team advised both hosts and guests how they could sign up for this
scheme through the government website, and a safe list of organisations offering
matching, identified by CRRC.

The other 20 approaches were offers or queries relating to providing a house, flat,
annex or room in their own house for refugees. After discussion with the
enquirer, 8 accommodation offers were referred on to our local councils, a
neighbouring Local Authority area or the East of England Local Government
Association. At least two of these resulted in a letting to re-settling refugees. The rest
were referred on either to appropriate national organisations dealing with hosting or
to other local authorities, and some decided not to pursue the query further for
personal reasons. One house offer was linked up to a group considering a community
sponsorship of a refugee family.

There is no doubt that the team have fulfilled a useful information-giving and
signposting role and have assisted the City Council in filtering offers that have come
through us, so that they only receive referrals that fit the necessary eligibility criteria
such as being prepared to accept a rent based on local housing allowance rates.

### Positive news

Two of our younger beneficiaries who met through CRRC got married this year. The
wedding was celebrated at the Friends Meeting House and was attended by three
members of the Family support team and the families’ focal point. We look forward
to another wedding of another recipient soon.

Two teenagers won a prestigious young entrepreneur award for an idea to help other
newly arrived refugees settle into their new lives and received local media coverage
in the press and on local TV.

## ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND EDUCATION SUPPORT

### English language support for adults

The aim of CRRC ESOL for adults is to respond to the needs of those who cannot attend
college classes, mainly because of childcare needs, poor health, and lack of literacy.
Since the beginning, CRRC has provided a very professional, purely volunteer-led
language support with Hilary Sutton and Monica Poulter being the organisers
supported by a large team of volunteer ESOL teachers.

As lockdown came to an end and a more normal life felt possible, CRRC started to plan
for a return to face-to face class teaching. It seemed the best way to meet the various
needs would be to run workshop sessions where students could work at their own
level and on skills they had identified as necessary for their future. CRRC reimbursed
bus fares and paid the taxi fare for a student with mobility issues.

In September 2021, the team opened with some trepidation, with 11 students, five
children, six volunteer teachers and two childcare workers all in one large meeting
room. Windows were flung open, hand gel applied and advice on lateral flow tests
issued. The ESOL workshop continued throughout the academic year to July 2022.
Sixteen students attended during the year. Numbers varied as some students were
able to move on. One left when he was offered more weekday hours at work after
practising with his teacher how to use appropriate language to request extra hours
from his supervisor. The volunteer teachers worked on topics as varied as giving name
and address to discussion of a school’s sex education policy.

Two students passed the B1 Listening and Speaking test (required for their UK
citizenship application) after dropping in to the workshop to practise with a teacher.
Even if students could not attend regularly, they knew that the ever-resourceful
teachers would always be available to help.

As Covid-19 restrictions eased, the team were able to respond again to requests for
one-to-one teachers at home. Seven new matches were made in the Spring, ranging
from an absolute beginner from Afghanistan to a beneficiary wanting to improve his
communication skills as he set up his own business. In the new year of 2022, the team
welcomed a small number of Afghan families who were resettling in Cambridge and
the surrounding area. They were offered home teaching, support and advice as
required, though the team was not able to find a teacher for every location. The team
also delivered a training session for ESOL volunteers working with Afghan families in
the Huntingdon area.

>
> With a room of our own in the Brampton Methodist Church Hall, strong support from CRRC English tutors Monica and Hilary and two boxes of English/Farsi picture dictionaries donated by Oxford University Press, the English Conversation Group began its weekly meetings in April 2022. It is intentionally social, a time for women refugees in the area – both Afghan and Ukrainian – to meet, chat and learn in a relaxed atmosphere. The two-hour sessions were run by volunteers drawn from CRRC and the Brampton Hub, led by Claire Senior, a former headmistress and English teacher. The activities ranged from speaking, reading, writing, role play and games to advice on online learning, library access, and out-of-classroom sessions to build up their knowledge of the local area. Among the many resources CRRC has provided are whiteboards, which have proved very popular with the beneficiaries.

Towards the end of the reporting period, the team became aware of an increasing
number of Ukrainian refugees settling in the area. The team contacted
Cambridge4Ukraine who were ready to offer support as required within CRRC’s
capacity.

**Thanks are due to the team of volunteer teachers who have offered their time and expertise through another challenging year and to the team of childcare workers who made it possible for parents to concentrate on their learning.**

For the future, the team will try to respond to the ever-widening needs of students,
from catch-up for those who missed two years of lessons during lockdown to new
arrivals, support for those with overseas qualifications and help with language
requirements for citizenship. Many students also need more opportunities to use
English language outside the classroom. One volunteer teacher introduced an Afghan
beneficiary to the local mother and baby group. This is the kind of engagement that
the team hopes to encourage in the future. Furthermore, with ever-increasing
requests for language support, CRRC needs to recruit more volunteers as the local
colleges are unable to meet demand.

### Educational support for the children

Nearly all school-age children from CRRC’s beneficiaries have been enrolled in the
one-to-one tuition programme provided by the CRRC children’s tuition team. Some
pre-school children also have had support from tutors. CRRC volunteers were matched
with the families and normally met the children once a week. The aim of this support
is to help the children to develop language skills, encourage conceptual
understanding, increase knowledge of their cultural community, and to build their
confidence and self-esteem. Many of the CRRC children’s tuition volunteers have been
qualified teachers or postgraduate students at Cambridge University. The volunteers
had the opportunity to meet once a month before the socials, to exchange ideas,
resources and concerns.

The one-to-one teachers supporting school-age children often also have helped with
liaising with the children’s school so that the child was supported in following the
curriculum at the appropriate level. Several of the one-to-one tutors have become
close friends with the children and the entire family and have engaged with many
different aspects of family life over time.

Since July 2021, 35 tutors have supported the children of the families. Recruitment
has been robust thanks to our administration team who have streamlined the
recruitment process. Reporting was also efficient due to the recruitment of an
administrative volunteer. The organisation Refugee Education also provided four
mentors to help with the service.

### First language support for the children

CRRC commissioned further Arabic classes, and Saussan Khalil, who teaches the
classes, reported that, despite the challenges of online learning, six of the 12 children
enrolled attended the online sessions regularly and made good progress. Between
September 2021 and April 2022, Kalamna Arabic classes were still being held
exclusively online due to the continuing Covid-19 restrictions. Four students were
enrolled in the classes. In May 2022, in-person classes returned and subsequently had
four returning students join who had attended the in-person classes pre-pandemic, as
well as two new students.

## FOCUS ON EMPLOYMENT AND MOBILITY

### Employment support

In May 2022, the team recruited a volunteer to help recipients with getting prepared
for employment. Three people were assisted with CV writing and job applications.
CRRC also made connections with PARCA who help with CV writing advice. Several
recipients together started a catering business and members of the core team offered
feedback on their menu and pricing scale. Where possible, the team tried to support
the catering businesses and commission their culinary skills for social and training
events.

### Mobility support

#### Bicycle project

Amanda, the enthusiastic bike coordinator of CRRC, continued to work in part with
The Bike Project in London to provide each beneficiary of CRRC, both adult and child,
with a working bike, plus helmet, lights and a secure lock. Bike training could be
restarted after pandemic related restrictions with several women taking part in The
Bike Project’s ‘Pedal Power’. This fantastic programme provides refugee women with
1-1 cycle lessons with female instructors.

#### Support with passing the UK driving test

CRRC Trustees consider that it is of significant benefit to our beneficiaries if they could
drive in the UK. Being able to drive could assist directly or indirectly with employment,
as well as help individuals and their families enjoy a better quality of life and move
more swiftly towards independence.

The UK driving test is in two parts – a theory test and a practical test. CRRC does not
pay for the theory test, the driving test or the provisional driving licence. Its support
focuses on paying for driving lessons. All CRRC beneficiaries applying for funding to
help pay for their lessons must have passed the theory test and hold a provisional
licence.

For those who have driven in their home country, CRRC offers to pay for 10 hours of
driving lessons. For those who have not, CRRC pays for 20 hours of lessons. In the
2021-22 financial year, 8 beneficiaries received funding towards payment for their
driving lessons, including two women.

CRRC’s driving policy is scheduled to undergo a major review in late 2022, not least
because the number of beneficiaries requesting funding has greatly increased,
reflecting the arrival of many Afghan families in the wake of the Taliban take-over in
August 2021. This has put a strain on financial resources and highlighted the need to
increase the budget for this item, alongside putting updated application criteria in
place.

## ACTIVITIES AND CULTURE

### School holiday activities

A big thank you to everyone involved in the activities team this year. It was great to
see just how many families got involved and how much they enjoyed the activities
that were organised.

With a dynamic and efficient new activities team and funding from Cambridgeshire
Community Foundation, the summer holiday programme 2021 got off to a successful
start with a day trip to Hunstanton with 70 family members and 8 volunteers in two
coaches who spent a glorious day on the beach.

The programme continued with an afternoon of ten pin bowling at the Cambridge
Leisure Centre. The Coton Village Fair on Bank Holiday Monday offered the
opportunity for some bargain-hunting on the bric-a-brac stalls, as well as a picnic and
a game of cricket on the recreation ground.

About 50 people attended the picnic and the team were very pleased that our newest
arrivals came to both the bowling and the picnic. The team was also delighted to be
able to introduce a representative, Gareth, from Cambridgeshire Community
Foundation to CRRC’s work and beneficiaries.

**We are very grateful to CCF for facilitating our holiday and after-school activities for three years with grant-funding.**

The colder weather and rising numbers of Covid-19 cases meant socials had
 to be paused again and that any indoor activities required very careful planning.
Fortunately, the North Pole ice rink and funfair on Parkers Piece was back and was
very popular with ice skating for over 20 skaters of all ages, rides and food in the lead
up to Christmas.

The beginning of 2022 saw the team take everyone bowling again because it was just
that popular! And finally, a trip to Wimpole Estate in May went down well with a big
group of families thanks to the generous staff at the National Trust.

> The trip to London was wonderful. We were able to see the most attractive and tourism places for the first time. It was fun and we had a great time. Many thanks, CRRC! *Naeem, CRRC beneficiary*

In March 2022, the families from Afghanistan who had recently been resettled in
Brampton and Huntingdon and supporting volunteers went on an excursion to
London. The group alighted at the London Eye carrying picnics and cameras, walked
across Westminster Bridge to Parliament Square, up the Mall for a picnic in St James
Park, and then on to Trafalgar Square and, via coach, past various landmarks.

### CRRC socials

CRRC has been running socials since December 2015 when the team welcomed the
first three beneficiary families. The socials provide the face-to-face contact on which
CRRC prides itself, involving the whole community, whilst offering private meeting
space for confidential conversations. As the number of beneficiaries and volunteers
has grown, the socials have grown. They are now held at a large primary school in
Cambridge and organised by a small team of volunteers with regular liaison with the
board of Trustees. The team is made up of a small, committed team of volunteers on
the organising committee liaising via WhatsApp and email to organise the monthly
socials. This greatly eased the workload of organising and increased the pool of
expertise and interests.

Due to Covid-19, the team did not start the socials again until September 2021. The
team’s main concern was how to continue to run the socials and remain safe. Socials
had to be organised outside using the schools outside space and the playing field. Two
local chefs (who were refugees themselves) were hired to cater for the first socials
since lockdown 2020. They brought a variety of delicious food and over 20 volunteers
helped with the arranging of tables, serving food, kitchen, and children’s games.

For the October social, the team was lucky to have warm weather to be able to remain
outside. Socials closed for the winter and resumed after Ramadan in May and June
2022 with both inside and outdoors activities. New families from Afghanistan who
arrived in Cambridgeshire during the spring joined the schedule of socials. A range of
activities were undertaken including crafts and football.

In response to the arrival of newer arrived families from Afghanistan, an additional
social was organised in a new venue on Marmalade Lane. It allowed some of the
families to meet each other as well as some of the core team members.

**CRRC gratefully thanks all volunteers of the socials team!**

## LEGAL SUPPORT

CRRC continued to offer support to one asylum-seeking family who were entering into
their third year waiting for a decision from the Home Office. Their first interview
failing, the family were supported with the appeal process and are hopeful that it will
be completed in 2023.

## CAMPAIGNS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND OUTREACH

### Campaigns

As a result of events in Afghanistan and Ukraine, refugee issues have risen up the news
agenda and trustees were interviewed on BBC Cambridgeshire’s morning news
programme several times over the year. CRRC were also invited to give presentations
to pupils at Cambourne and Comberton Village colleges to help students understand
the challenges facing refugees even when they have reached a place of safety.

In the wake of the fall of Kabul and a huge surge of interest in volunteering, a public
meeting of support groups was organised at the Friends Meeting House in September
2021 to explain to potential new volunteers what local organisations do and how they
could help.

Since the invasion of Ukraine, CRRC has been collating information on hosting
refugees, donating and finding help on arrival, which is available on the website. The
team has also been liaising with other groups and attended a networking meeting for
refugee support groups hosted by CamCRAG and Dr Julian Huppert at Jesus College in
April 2022.

Nationally, CRRC continued to campaign against the Nationality and Borders Bill with
trustees speaking at a rally outside the Cambridge Guildhall in March, attending the
Rwanda rally in June and sharing petitions on social media. Sadly, this punitive and
unethical bill, which was opposed by the Church of England, the UNHCR, Liberty, the
Law Society and hundreds of refugee organisations, passed into law in July 2022.

However, the Together with Refugees coalition campaign continued, particularly with
regard to the treatment of unaccompanied minors and the Rwanda scheme.

The quarterly newsletter has gone out regularly to 470 subscribers, showcasing the
amazing work of CRRC’s volunteers and the successes of our beneficiaries. The CRRC
Facebook group has 1.5k members and Twitter feed has almost 1.2k followers. Over
the year, CRRC’s website saw over 39,000 page views.

## Financial review and reserves policy

During this fifth year of operations, the budget has been reviewed during regular
trustee meetings, ensuring that new expenditure is checked and authorised by the
trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for ensuring that expenditure remains
within agreed limits. The net receipts for the year were £3,473.

At 30 June 2022, CRRC’s free cash reserves were £57,650. The charity does not have
a reserves policy. Trustees review spending regularly, adjust budgets as required,
encourage donations within the local community and plan fundraising activities to
ensure that ongoing and planned support of beneficiaries and all CRRC’s activities can
be maintained.

## Plans for the future

CRRC’s work has adjusted and expanded over the course of the last year. We have
been learning about the needs of more recently arriving refugees from Afghanistan
and the Ukraine. We have extended important collaborations with local agencies and
supporters to work towards CRRC’s overarching aim to promote supportive conditions
for integration to enable refugees to achieve independence and settle harmoniously.
Settling in a new country can be difficult and complex and CRRC’s goal is to provide
newly arrived refugees with connections to people able to support them with these
tasks.

CRRC will face major challenges related with the ongoing economic crisis and an
increasing colder social climate. We plan to critically analyse the needs of beneficiaries
and CRRC’s priorities over the course of the next financial year to strengthen our
strategy. We want to ensure to be able to remain resilient, as an organisation, to
sustainably provide critical services to refugees to facilitate achieving economic
stability and becoming self-reliant. We will aim to further expand on the engagement
of established refugee and diaspora communities. We are enthusiastic to continue to
draw on the large number of volunteers in Cambridge and Cambridgeshire, committed
to assist refugees to realise their potential and to contribute to the receiving society.
