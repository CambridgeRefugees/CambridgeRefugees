CRRC could not carry out its work without the tremendous contributions from its many volunteers and supporters. CRRC works in a collaborative manner, recognising that the nature of a volunteer-led group requires flexibility, whilst ensuring that it fulfils tasks that it commits to, within given timeframes to achieve its objectives. The organisation actively seeks and values volunteers from diverse backgrounds, life experiences and perspectives.

There has been a high level of ongoing engagement from potential volunteers getting in touch with CRRC to express their interest in being involved, suggesting that the operational model is effective.

Between July 2022 and June 2023, 29 new volunteers joined CRRC to take up a range of roles. The team completed basic and enhanced DBS checks for these volunteers, in line with UK Government requirements and according to their role. At the end of the financial year, CRRC had over 161 active volunteers, as well as further excellent applicants waiting for potential opportunities. The huge number of volunteer hours provided, and level of enthusiasm and dedication shown by our volunteers form a vital part of the CRRC community.

Several volunteer gatherings took place to allow volunteers to exchange ideas, and to introduce prospective volunteers to understand their potential role prior to signing up.
