The Refugee Council, Safe Passage, JCWI and others in the Together With Refugees Coalition organised a week of action from the 18th to the 24th of October. This included a rally outside the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday 20th and celebrations to welcome Good Chance Theatre Company's giant puppet Little Amal.

Little Amal set off from the Syrian Turkish border in July and has since walked across Europe to highlight the plight of refugees and asylum-seekers.

Further details of the Home Office's plans continue to emerge, and involve immunity for Border Force officers who cause the death of migrants in the Channel and medically unethical X-rays for any young asylum-seeker who says they are a minor but might be over 18. Please continue to lobby your representatives over this inhumane and discriminatory Bill.
