The Communications team are delighted to be joined by Kay, who will be taking over the CRRC Twitter feed management from Sarah. She is keen to encourage any CRRC volunteers to send her any news items, campaigns, images or events you would like shared. You can contact her [here](mailto:kay.powell@cambridgerefugees.org?subject=CRRC%20Twitter). Members of the CRRC Facebook group can share information on that forum but if you are not on Facebook and would like something relevant shared there, please contact Catharine or Dan [here](mailto:core@cambridgerefugees.org?subject=CRRC%20Facebook).
