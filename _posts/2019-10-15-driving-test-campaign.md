In March this year, Trustee Adrian Matthews launched a UK Government petition to reverse the decision to abolish language support for driving-test candidates. This was accompanied by a letter-writing campaign to local MPs. NE Cambs MP Lucy Frazer responded to her constituent’s letters by contacting the Minister for Transport, Jesse Norman. However, the Minister stated that the DVSA had no plans to assess the effect of the change, despite a formal review in 2019 being promised by his predecessor five years ago.

Daniel Zeichner, MP for Cambridge City, who sits on the Transport Select Committee, tabled a motion, and Heidi Allen, MP for S Cambs suggested a cross-party approach, which proved difficult to organise in light of her own party status. Our petition garnered well over 2000 signatures, which is significantly more than there were responses to the Government’s consultation, which informed the unsatisfactory change to the regulations. It would be great if CRRC supporters could continue to lobby their local MPs for the promised review!
