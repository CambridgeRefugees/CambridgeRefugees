The *Well-being and Work for Refugees Integration Project* was launched on 21 October with funds from the EU's Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund. A preliminary consultative forum met online on 24 September, attended by representatives of CRRC, Cambridge Ethnic Community Forum, Cambridge Central Mosque, local health and mental health practitioners, employers, ESOL teachers, and local government officers. The City Council Communities officers reported that they have continued to provide all services throughout lockdown and the subsequent restrictions.

The Strategic Migration Partnership team for the East of England local government association reports that they have been busy preparing curricula for the project. There has been a great deal of interest from local organisations in these new courses designed for refugees, which are being tested before release. Each of the four curricula – IT skills, study skills, job search skills and driving theory – will last for 30 hours and will come with worksheets and lesson plans to enable face-to-face teaching, but could be adapted for online teaching. As part of the same project, the Refugee Council is now offering therapeutic services to both adult and child refugees and asylum-seekers in Cambridge.
