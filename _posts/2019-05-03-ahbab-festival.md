The fourth annual Ahbab Festival took place on the 15th, 16th and 17th February at Cambridge Junction, celebrating Middle Eastern and North African culture. The Festival brought together an array of musical performances including the Baladi Blues Ensemble, the Ayoub Sisters and Amira Kheir, as well as screenings of the acclaimed films *The Wolf of Baghdad* and *Femme Ecrite*.

CRRC families and volunteers were again kindly offered tickets and attended events on the Friday and the Sunday evening. The Festival was a big success with a buzzing atmosphere, a beautifully decorated foyer and delicious food from Bedouin Cambridge’s pop-up restaurant. We are already looking forward to next year’s Festival!
