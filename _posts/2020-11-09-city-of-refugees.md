Saira Niazi is in conversation with two Syrian refugees who have settled in London. They share their experiences and footage of their journey from Syria to the UK, as well as their stories of making a new home in London.

This was a live online talk hosted in June 2020 as part of Refugee Week. A recording is available to view between 9 November and 31 December 2020 [here](https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london/whats-on/city-refugees-conversation?id=262209).
