We were very pleased to be invited again to take part in a workshop day in October for Year 10s at Comberton Village College on Religion, Philosophy and Ethics. The students were lively and engaged, imagining what the needs might be of an imaginary Afghan refugee family arriving in Cambridge.

We were also invited to talk to a group of Ukrainians learning English with the Cambridge Russian-Speaking Society along with colleagues from CECF and Cambridge Sustainable Food about ways to source free or low-cost goods. We continue to support national campaigns against the hostile environment and, in particular, the Rwanda policy, and encourage all supporters to write to their MP about this.
