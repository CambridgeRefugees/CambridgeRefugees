The start of the Easter holidays saw a large group of about 40 spend a fascinating (if slightly scary!) day on 8 April visiting the Sedgwick Museum on the Downing site. The children were given worksheets and activities and had a wonderful time getting to know the dinosaurs and fossils in the University's collection. We are very grateful to Layla Evans for organising this and would be delighted to hear from volunteers who might be able to help with the summer activity programme. Please contact Layla through [the CRRC email address](mailto:info@cambridgerefugees.org?subject=Summer%20activity%20programme).
