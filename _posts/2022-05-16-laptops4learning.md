Do you or your friends work for large businesses which upgrade their IT on a regular basis (ARM, Cambridge Assessment, Marshalls Aerospace, Addenbrookes, etc)? We are looking for contacts in Cambridge businesses to ask if they would let us have their old technology. This saves them having to dispose of it and allows us to meet an increasing need.

The last two years have really brought home the importance of computer connectivity, especially for learners who cannot access teaching any other way. With hundreds of Ukrainian refugees about to arrive, many in need of laptops to continue schooling, learn English, access banking, and stay in touch with family, we are partnering with Laptops4Learning to acquire, clean and refurbish secondhand computers for refugees.

If you can help point us at the right people, please [contact us](/contact.html).
