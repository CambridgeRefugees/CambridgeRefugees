![Two people work on a bicycle. Â© Adrian Matthews 2019](/images/2019-11-03-bike-maintenance-workshop.jpg){: .float-right} The bike experts at OWL ran another bike maintenance workshop for our families on Monday 21st October. There were ten participants, three adults and seven children, all keen to learn how to keep their bikes working.

One family brought four bikes, three of which were repaired and brought up to a good standard. The fourth bike was in too poor condition to mend, so CRRC funded the purchase of a replacement as it is so important for both adults and children to be able to get around independently. One of the girls also received a new bike, and pumps and chain oil were bought for the families.

The team at OWL were impressed by the skills displayed.
