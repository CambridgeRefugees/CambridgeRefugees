This Fitzwilliam Museum Virtual Talk, organised as part of Refugee Week at 1.30pm on 17 June, centres around the theme of migration and the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean.

The event follows a special display by contemporary artist Issam Kourbaj, currently on view at the Fitzwilliam Museum until September 6, 2021. The panel talk aims to highlight the response in contemporary Art and Poetry to the crisis, as well as that of Museums. Panellists include the artist Issam Kourbaj and celebrated poet Ruth Padel, as well as a representative of CRRC.
