Families from Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine got together over half term to enjoy a day at Wimpole. The house was closed but the families explored the gardens before visiting Home Farm. The children loved meeting the new piglets, the rare breed cattle and the enormous shire horses. There was just time for a quick ice cream before an unexpected thunderstorm struck and everyone had to take refuge in the barns.
