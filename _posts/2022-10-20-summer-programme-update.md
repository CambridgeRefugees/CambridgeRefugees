The summer activities programme for our beneficiary families was already underway in July with a flower arranging workshop and continued in August with a picnic on Jesus Green and a visit from the Afghan families based around Huntingdon. For many of the Huntingdon families, this was their first visit to Cambridge and they took the opportunity for some general sightseeing at the same time. September saw a much anticipated trip to Hunstanton with two coaches leaving from Cambridge and one from Huntingdon. Families from Afghanistan, Ukraine, Syria and Iraq spent a day exploring rock pools, building sandcastles and paddling in the sea. The final event in the programme was a visit to the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge at the end of September and already it is nearly half term!
