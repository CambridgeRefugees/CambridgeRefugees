title: Childcare during English lessons

Childcare volunteers take care of under school-age children while their parents are attending to their English lessons. There are usually 2-3 childcare volunteers during each session, and the aim is to keep the children happy and occupied with play, singing and reading. We donâ€™t do any personal care and the parents are responsible for taking care of toileting, other personal hygiene or comforting their child/children in case of any upset.

The most important quality in this role is kindness. You should also be trustworthy and happy to play with children. It is important that you understand child safeguarding issues (we provide safeguarding training in induction) and all our childcare volunteers will have their DBS check before they can start with volunteering. The sessions are two hours long.

An enhanced DBS check is necessary for this role. Further information can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).
