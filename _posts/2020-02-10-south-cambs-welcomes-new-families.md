South Cambridgeshire District Council has agreed to accept two new refugee families this spring, in addition to three families who arrived towards the end of last year. CRRC has been helping the three new families resettled in villages near to Cambridge with small adjustments to their new homes, accessing our ESOL classes, obtaining household items through our link with Emmaus and supplying mobile phones to family members donated by our friends at Cambridge Assessment. We look forward to inviting them all to our socials and finding out how they are settling in.
