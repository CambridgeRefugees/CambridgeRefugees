The garden team have had a busy spring and early summer helping 6 new Afghan families settle in to the Cambridge area. We helped with garden tools, planted flowers, tomatoes, beans, cucumbers and courgettes. One family wanted only flowers and herbs, so we filled pots with thyme, mint, lavender, sunflowers and roses for their patio area. All the families had some gardening knowledge and were keen to be involved in the upkeep of their gardens.
