### Show that #CambridgeWelcomesRefugees

The Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign is asking people in Cambridge to pledge what they can to support the resettlement of refugees.

Cambridge citizens have a strong tradition of welcoming and supporting people seeking refuge from war and oppression. We want to keep this tradition alive by helping refugees arriving from Syria, and other war-torn countries, to start afresh.

If you want to help, you can pledge your support using the form [at the bottom of the page](#pledge-form).

### How many refugees will be coming to Cambridge?

The City Council have agreed to resettle a minimum of 50 vulnerable refugees from Syria. This is a good start, but we hope they can throw the doors wider to receive at least 100.

Budget cuts have hit the council hard. By pledging our help Cambridge residents can support the council and enable the city to increase its quota of refugees.

### When will more refugees arrive in Cambridge?

We are not yet sure, but making your pledge now will help us prepare to help them rebuild their lives.

### What can I pledge?

There’s a host of practical ways you can help. Here are some ideas:

- Accommodation: A flat or house to rent (paid at local authority rates), or space in your home. Meeting rooms and halls.
- Goods: Groceries, furniture, household and electrical goods, clothing, toys, baby/toddler equipment, stationery, a haircut.
- Transport: Van or car use, bicycles/bicycle maintenance, help with removals.
- Skills: English Language tuition, Arabic translation/interpretation, trade skills.
- Personal support: Advocacy and assistance, e.g. applying for schools, registering at a surgery. Childcare, child fostering (through Cambridge Children’s Services), friendship.
- Money: We will ensure any funds donated will reach the appropriate service or organisation.

### What happens next?

We are building a database of people and their pledges. We can then plan a coordinated resettlement programme and reassure the council that there is ample grass-roots commitment to helping refugees in practical ways.

*Your personal information will be kept confidential*

Of course things change, so if you find that later down the line you cannot deliver on the pledge, that's OK.
