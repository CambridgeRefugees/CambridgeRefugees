## Opportunities to get involved

Thank you for your interest in volunteering with CRRC. We have recently experienced a *huge* increase in offers of help and our volunteer administrators are working their way through these. At the present time we are unable to process more applications but hope very much that you will check back regularly as the situation changes.

The only exceptions to this are that we're always looking for trained ESOL teachers who are able to teach in a private home, and also for childcare help during these English lessons - see the details below.

<!-- We always need enthusiastic people to volunteer for the organization. We can't offer money but it's extremely rewarding to see your work directly helping local refugees. You will meet a bunch of fascinating people if you work with us. We are also very happy to write recommendation letters and give out certificates for the soft skills you acquire during your work with us if this is of help to you.

Please note that taking on a permanent volunteering role requires you to work about 4 hours a week and that you should be able to make this time commitment for at least half a year - we want to avoid too much flux. -->
