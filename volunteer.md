## Opportunities to get involved

We always need enthusiastic people to volunteer for the organization. We can't offer money but it's extremely rewarding to see your work directly helping local refugees. You will meet a bunch of fascinating people if you work with us. We are also very happy to write recommendation letters and give out certificates for the soft skills you acquire during your work with us if this is of help to you.

Please note that taking on a permanent volunteering role requires you to work about 4 hours a week and that you should be able to make this time commitment for at least half a year - we want to avoid too much flux.
