We are looking to recruit someone with general IT skills, able to train our beneficiaries in the use of laptops, which we will be providing from grant funding, for both schoolwork and remote language learning via Zoom or Skype. This role will be within the Education Team but will also involve coordination with the Family Liaison Team.

Since this will involve going into homes to train women and school-age children, the ideal volunteer would be someone with some basic Arabic and preferably a woman.

As the role involves close contact with vulnerable persons the post is subject to DBS checks. Further information can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).

### The role specifically involves:

- Providing IT support on laptop use in family homes
- Building trust with individuals and families
- Coordinating with other volunteers to ensure full support for the families.

### Skills required:

- Experience in setting up and troubleshooting computers
- Experience in explaining how to use computers to novices
- Ability to gain the confidence of the families
- Foreign language ability would be a bonus, especially Arabic
- Experience working in a similar environment or role would be ideal but is not essential

### In return, youâ€™ll get an opportunity to:

- Have a front-line opportunity to help refugees settle in and make a positive contribution to their ongoing welfare.
- Develop your organizational and communication skills
- Work with a wonderful and passionate group of volunteers from the Cambridge area
- Make a real and significant difference to the lives of refugees
