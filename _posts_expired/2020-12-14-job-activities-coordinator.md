If you love organising outings, this could be the role for you!

Operating within the Education and Family Liaison Teams, the purpose of this role is to organise a programme of activities and outings during the school holidays. These will allow the beneficiary families to spend leisure time together relaxing, getting to know the area and having fun. Most of the beneficiary families have primary-school-age children so suitability for this age-group should be the focus.

In previous years, activities have included ice-skating at Christmas, visits to the University museums at Easter, picnics at Lammas Land, trips to Ely to go on the river, visits to the zoo and a trip to the seaside. A small budget is available.

An enhanced DBS check is necessary for this role. Further information can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).

### The role specifically involves:

- Coming up with ideas for activities, assessing their feasibility and establishing (and minimising) costs
- Building trust with individuals and families
- Coordinating with other volunteers to ensure full support for the families.

### Skills required:

- Experience in organising group activities
- Ability to gain the confidence of the families
- Foreign language ability would be a bonus, especially Arabic
- Experience working in a similar environment or role would be ideal but is not essential

### In return, youâ€™ll get an opportunity to:

- Have a front-line opportunity to help refugees settle in and make a positive contribution to their ongoing welfare.
- Develop your organizational and communication skills
- Work with a wonderful and passionate group of volunteers from the Cambridge area
- Make a real and significant difference to the lives of refugees
