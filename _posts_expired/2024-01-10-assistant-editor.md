Are you an enthusiastic team player with an interest in getting a comprehensive overview of the many activities of CRRC and with 2-3 hours per week to spare over the upcoming months?

As CRRCâ€™s assistant editor, you will work closely with editor Josephine Munton and chair of the board of trustees Heidi Radke to create a publicly shareable version of our annual report. 

We're looking for someone with a flair for editing, proofreading and layout, but we don't need a grammar scholar. On-the-job-training will be provided. 

The work can be done remotely, with an option to meet in person in Cambridge.

We will be delighted to hear from you!
