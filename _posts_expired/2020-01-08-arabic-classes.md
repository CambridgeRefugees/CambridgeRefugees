Kalamna  have been offering Arabic classes in Cambridge for 5 years now, and currently run 7 classes with over 50 students. They say:

> we have run Arabic classes for children and adults, held social events, built up a community, held training events, and developed countless resources and materials for learning Arabic. But our most important achievements have been making Arabic learning fun and engaging, and all the new friends and connections we've made along the way!

If you'd like to learn Arabic, whether you're an absolute beginner or already know some Arabic, the new classes start on the 12th of January. To find out more and book a place, please contact their Administrator, [Nadia El-Anis](mailto:hello@kalamna.org).
