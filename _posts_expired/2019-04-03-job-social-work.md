Join Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign as a Volunteer!

CRRC is looking for an enthusiastic volunteer with experience in social work, the welfare system and knowledge of the benefits system and processes.

As a charity that works with vulnerable adults and children of resettled or asylum seeking families, we are looking for a candidate with the commitment, experience, connections and time to be pivotal in developing and shaping the new CRRC advice and support volunteer sub-group, alongside the existing Board of Trustees.

This group will aim to give advice and practical support to refugee families, for example by accompanying our service users to the Citizens' Advice Bureau or the job centre, or by helping to trouble-shoot when the families face difficulties with their payments. The work will be done in close cooperation with the CRRC translators and family befrienders, the focal points.

CRRC is a small organisation; therefore our volunteers play a very active role in the day-to-day running of the organisation. You would be expected to commit around 5 hours per week in addition to participating, as co-opted adviser, in the monthly Board of Trustees meetings.

If you would relish such a challenge and share our commitment to supporting refugees in Cambridge and Cambridgeshire to adapt to their new environment, to facilitate their independence and to develop and contribute to the broader community, particularly in these challenging political and economic times, then we would be delighted to hear from you.

All CRRC positions are voluntary, but they offer excellent opportunities to work alongside a committed group of volunteers and to contribute to the well-being of the local community.
