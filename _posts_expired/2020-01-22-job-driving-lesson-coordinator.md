As an important step towards the independence that comes with driving, CRRC supports one adult in each family with a maximum of 5 driving lesson hours and, if needed, interpreter support for the theory test.

This new role is to coordinate and organise support with driving schools and online theory testing, establishing firstly who might be a good candidate for lessons.

You'll need to be well organised and good at keeping records and diaries for this role, but you will be providing a great service to our beneficiaries and will have the opportunity to get to know many of them.

Full details will be provided to applicants.
