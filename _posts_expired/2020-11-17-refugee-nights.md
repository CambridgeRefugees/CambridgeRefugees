Refugee Nights is a free virtual festival telling refugees' stories through conversations, art and music. One night each week for three weeks, Syrian refugee Hassan Akkad will guide participants through a range of talks, topics and performances, celebrating refugees' contributions to their UK communities.

The festival is being run by the Imperial War Museums Institute. Further details, including information on how to participate, please see [here](https://www.iwm.org.uk/events/refugee-nights).
