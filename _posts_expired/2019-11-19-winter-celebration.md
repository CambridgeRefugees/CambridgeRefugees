CRRC volunteers and families are invited to a winter celebration with The Centre for the Study of Global Human Movement at the University of Cambridge. They promise a quiz night with prizes, (potluck) presentations on research at the University, poetry and music to celebrate the end of the term.

To find out more, take a look at [their website](https://www.humanmovement.cam.ac.uk/events/research-seminar-series-03).
