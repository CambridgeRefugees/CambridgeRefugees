We are very excited to announce that we will be resuming regular volunteer socials! These will be on the fourth Wednesday of each month at the Maypole on Portugal Place. The first one will be next Wednesday (26th May) from 7.30pm. Please let us know if you will be coming because numbers will be limited. With luck, there will be no restrictions by the end of June.

We hope to re-start Refugee Socials as soon as this is allowed indoors. We would love to hear from you if you would like to join the team planning and organising the socials, which are likely to be popular when they begin again.
