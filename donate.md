### Donate money

We rely entirely on the generosity of our supporters to continue the work that we do for refugees resettling here in Cambridge. As CRRC is run entirely by volunteers from their own homes we have no staff, office or administration costs.  Your donation will go directly towards helping the refugee families themselves.

To make a donation:

Gift Aid is reclaimed by the charity from the tax you pay for the current tax year. By filling in the form, you allow us to claim 25p Gift Aid on every dollar you donate.

### Donate items

Refugee families in Cambridge are often in need of items to support them in setting up their new lives. Please see the list of items we are currently looking for below.

We are only able to accept items advertised on the list. We would be grateful if you could please ensure that all items are of good quality and are ready to be used â€“ no torn clothing or broken toys, household items should be clean and clothing should be washed and dried.
