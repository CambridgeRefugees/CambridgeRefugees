### Monetary donations

We rely entirely on the generosity of our supporters to continue the work that we do for refugees resettling here in Cambridge. CRRC is run by volunteers from their own homes so you can be sure that your donation will go to those in need rather than the costs of employees, offices or administration.

To make a donation, please visit our MyDonate page by clicking this button:

<a href="#"><button class="btn donate">Donate</button></a>

Please consider filling in our [gift aid declaration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eje4Qo9vHNYMxbXFKfTPF0UN6G_A2zZp/view) to boost your donation by 25p of Gift Aid for every Â£1 you donate. Gift Aid is reclaimed by the charity from the tax you pay for the current tax year. By filling in the form, you allow us to claim Gift Aid on your donation and any donations you make to CRRC in the future or have made in the past 4 years. The completed form should be returned to us via [email](mailto:info@cambridgerefugees.org).

Please notify us if you wish to cancel this declaration, change your name or home address, or if you no longer pay sufficient tax on your income and/or capital gains. If you pay Income Tax at the higher or additional rate and want to receive the additional tax relief due to you, you must include all your Gift Aid donations on your Self-Assessment tax return or ask HM Revenue and Customs to adjust your tax code.

### In-kind donations

CRRC is currently running a donations drive for refugee families. The list below shows all the items that we are looking for. Please note that we can *only* accept items in the list as we have no storage space and are therefore looking for things that will be immediately useful to families. Anything we receive that the families do not need or want will be given to a charity store capable of handling large numbers of donations.

Items needed most urgently are in red. The list will be kept up-to-date as goods are collected, please make certain that your donation is still needed before donating.

Please ensure your donated goods are of good quality, no torn clothing or broken toys. Ensure clothing is washed and dried before donating, as CRRC has no facilities to clean them before giving them to the families. Please also make sure toys and household goods are clean before donating.

When you are ready to donate, please [email us at our donations address](mailto:donations@cambridgerefugees.org) to arrange a drop-off.

NB We have very limited storage space and will ONLY accept items on this list.
