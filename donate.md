### Donate money

We rely entirely on the generosity of our supporters to continue the work that we do for refugees resettling here in Cambridge. As CRRC is run entirely by volunteers from their own homes we have no staff, office or administration costs.  Your donation will go directly towards helping the refugee families themselves.

To boost your donation by 25%, please select the Gift Aid option for your donation. We can reclaim 25p on every pound you donate from the tax you have paid to add to your donation!

If you pay Income Tax at the higher or additional rate and want to receive the additional tax relief due to you, you must include all your Gift Aid donations on your Self-Assessment tax return or ask HM Revenue and Customs to adjust your tax code. Please notify us if you wish to cancel this declaration, change your name or home address, or if you no longer pay sufficient tax on your income and/or capital gains.

### Donate items

Refugee families in Cambridge are often in need of items to support them in setting up their new lives. Please see the list of items we are currently looking for below.

We are only able to accept items advertised on the list. We would be grateful if you could please ensure that all items are of good quality and are ready to be used â€“ no torn clothing or broken toys, household items should be clean and clothing should be washed and dried.

When you are ready to donate, please [email us at our donations address](mailto:donations@cambridgerefugees.org) to arrange a drop-off.
