## WHO WE ARE

CRRC is entirely volunteer-led, and relies on volunteers’ time and donations to deliver its statement of purpose. CRRC is led by the Board of Trustees, and there is a core group of volunteers who coordinate the different areas in subgroups, or are involved in behind-the-scenes operations.

## YOUR RIGHTS

Right of access — you have a right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing information about you, and to request access to this information.

Right to rectification — you may ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate, and you may also ask us to remove information which is inaccurate or incomplete. If you inform us that your personal data is inaccurate, we will inform relevant third parties with whom we have shared your data so that they may update their own records.

Right of portability — you have a right to obtain your personal data from us and reuse it for your own purposes.

Right to be forgotten — you have a right to seek the erasure of your data, for example where it is no longer necessary for us to continue holding or processing your personal data. This right is not absolute, as we may need to continue processing this information to comply with a legal obligation.

Right to restriction — you have a right to ask us to restrict our processing of your information if:

*   You contest its accuracy and we need to verify whether it is accurate.
*   You ask us to restrict use of it instead of deleting it.
*   We no longer need the information for the purpose of processing, but you need it to establish or defend legal claims.
*   You have objected to processing of your information being necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. The restriction would apply while we carry out a balancing act between your rights and our legitimate interests. If you exercise your right to restrict processing, we would still need to process your information for the purpose of exercising or defending legal claims, for the purpose of protecting the rights of another person, or for public interest reasons.
