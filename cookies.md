This web page sets out how the Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign (CRRC) uses cookies. By using the CRRC website, you consent to this use of cookies.

For more information about how we handle your personal information, please see our separate [Privacy Policy](/privacy.html).

CRRC may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy was last updated on 18 June 2019.


## What are cookies?

A cookie is a file stored on your computer by your web browser when requested to do so by a web server. This may contain a unique identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that allows our servers to identify you and hence provide an individualised service.

Cookies may be used to identify and track users as they navigate a website (giving the provider useful information about features that the users value or have problems with) and also to identify users returning to a website (avoiding the need to log in every time you visit).

We may also store information in your browser using the local storage facility it provides. This information is used in the same way as cookies and is covered by this policy. All references to cookies from this point on should be read as including all information stored in your browser about you, by whatever means.


## What cookies do you use?

The CRRC website does not use cookies. When you follow links from other routes (such as from our mailing-list emails), third parties (such as our mailing-list provider MailChimp) may use cookies, and you should refer to their separate policies. See the separate [Privacy Policy](/privacy.html) for a list of organisations with whom we may share your data.


## How do I block cookies?

You can configure most browsers not to accept cookies and the CRRC website will work fine if you do choose to block cookies.

Here are instructions on how to stop some common browsers from accepting cookies.



*   Chrome – choose Settings from the menu, click Show Advanced Settings... and then click the 'Content Settings...' button under the Privacy heading. The top section of the dialog box that is shown controls cookies, so select 'Block sites from setting any data'.
*   Firefox – open your settings (called Options in Windows) and choose the Privacy section. Choose 'Use custom settings for History' from the dropdown menu in the History section and deselect the 'Accept cookies from sites' checkbox.
*   Safari – choose Settings and then click the Privacy section. For 'Block cookies and other website data', choose 'Always'.


## How do I delete cookies?

Just as for blocking cookies, most browsers let you delete the cookies that have already been stored.



*   Chrome – choose Settings from the menu, click Show Advanced Settings... and then click the 'Clear browsing data...' button under the Privacy heading. Select the checkbox labelled 'Delete cookies and other site and plug-in data' and then click Clear Browsing Data.
*   Firefox – open your settings (called Options in Windows) and choose the Privacy section. Choose 'Use custom settings for History' from the dropdown menu in the History section and click Show Cookies. Click Remove All Cookies.
*   Safari – choose Settings and then click the Privacy section. Click 'Remove all Website Data...'.
