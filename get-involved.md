## Pledge to help

The Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign is asking people in Cambridge to pledge what they can to support the resettlement of refugees.

Cambridge citizens have a strong tradition of welcoming and supporting people seeking refuge from war and oppression. We want to keep this tradition alive by helping refugees arriving from Syria, and other war-torn countries, to start afresh.

If you want to show your support publically, take a picture with your pledge, post it on social media and send it to us info@cambridgerefugees.org!
