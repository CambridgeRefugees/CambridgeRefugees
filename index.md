*[We stand ready to support Afghan refugees]({% post_url 2021-08-27-afghanistan %}) and will work with the local councils to facilitate their arrival.*

Cambridge has always been ready and willing to welcome refugees in times of crisis, and there have rarely been more people fleeing persecution and war. Offering sanctuary is a proud Cambridge tradition. Weâ€™re good at it, we always have been.

The Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign (CRRC) is a group of volunteers, initially set up by Citizens UK, that works with other organisations in Cambridge to welcome refugees and those seeking asylum. We aim to build positive public opinion about refugees, and to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer to help those newly arrived in the area.

We work with the local authority, landlords and refugees to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer their services and provisions to help those newly arrived in the area.
