*The City and District Councils expect around 1500 Ukrainian refugees, and almost all need phones and SIM cards, and many also laptops. This need is urgent.*

Cambridge has always been ready and willing to welcome refugees in times of crisis, and there have rarely been more people fleeing persecution and war. Offering sanctuary is a proud Cambridge tradition. Weâ€™re good at it, we always have been.

The Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign (CRRC) is a group of volunteers, initially set up by Citizens UK, that works with other organisations in Cambridge to welcome refugees and those seeking asylum. We aim to build positive public opinion about refugees, and to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer to help those newly arrived in the area. We work with local authorities, landlords, refugees, asylum-seekers, and other local groups and service providers to support our beneficiaries.

*The UK Government proposes to send asylum seekers to Rwanda instead of following its obligations under international law. [Write to your MP](https://www.writetothem.com/) urging them to fight this illegal and immoral course of action.*
