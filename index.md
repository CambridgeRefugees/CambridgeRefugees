Cambridge has always been ready and willing to welcome refugees in times of crisis, and there have rarely been more people fleeing persecution and war. Offering sanctuary is a proud Cambridge tradition. Weâ€™re good at it, we always have been.

**If you're a Cambridge resident, please sign [the City Council petition](https://democracy.cambridge.gov.uk/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?id=61&fbclid=IwAR2YUdMceUoJzkFkBv5fOPQpmAkZUnpELpB62MbF4EO5kwfjQcTA6UJx5Tc) calling for more refugees to be resettled here. If enough residents sign, the Council are obliged to debate it at their October meeting. (Signing means creating an account with a Cambridge address.)**

The Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign (CRRC) is a group of volunteers, initially set up by Citizens UK, that works with other organisations in Cambridge to welcome refugees and those seeking asylum. We aim to build positive public opinion about refugees, and to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer to help those newly arrived in the area.

We work with the local authority, landlords and refugees to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer their services and provisions to help those newly arrived in the area.
