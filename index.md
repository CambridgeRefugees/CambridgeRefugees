*Urgent: the UK Government's Borders Bill is due for its second reading next week, and is essentially the same as the [New Plan for Immigration]({% link npfi-2021.md %}). It is being rushed through before the results of the consultation and all the obvious flaws that were pointed out by expert groups have been made public or indeed addressed. The advice we gave about the NPfI still stands: it is illegal and immoral. Please [write to your MP pointing this out]({% post_url 2021-07-14-borders-bill %}).*

Cambridge has always been ready and willing to welcome refugees in times of crisis, and there have rarely been more people fleeing persecution and war. Offering sanctuary is a proud Cambridge tradition. Weâ€™re good at it, we always have been.

The Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign (CRRC) is a group of volunteers, initially set up by Citizens UK, that works with other organisations in Cambridge to welcome refugees and those seeking asylum. We aim to build positive public opinion about refugees, and to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer to help those newly arrived in the area.

We work with the local authority, landlords and refugees to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer their services and provisions to help those newly arrived in the area.
