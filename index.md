*CRRC is shocked and saddened at events in Ukraine. If you want to help, please donate to aid groups working on the Ukrainian borders, such as [Hope and Aid Direct](https://www.hopeandaiddirect.org.uk/Appeal/ukraine) or the [International Red Cross](https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-crisis-appeal). Please do not collect material aid unless you have personal connections with a group in the region which has requested this. Please also [sign the petition asking the UK Government to assist Ukrainian refugees](https://www.change.org/p/borisjohnson-and-ukhomeoffice-help-ukrainian-refugees-helpukrainianrefugees).*

*The Nationality and Borders Bill will criminalise Ukrainians attempting to reach friends and family in the UK by irregular means, just as it will Afghans. [Write to your MP](https://www.writetothem.com/) urging them to fight this Anti-Refugee Bill.*

Cambridge has always been ready and willing to welcome refugees in times of crisis, and there have rarely been more people fleeing persecution and war. Offering sanctuary is a proud Cambridge tradition. Weâ€™re good at it, we always have been.

The Cambridge Refugee Resettlement Campaign (CRRC) is a group of volunteers, initially set up by Citizens UK, that works with other organisations in Cambridge to welcome refugees and those seeking asylum. We aim to build positive public opinion about refugees, and to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer to help those newly arrived in the area.

We work with the local authority, landlords and refugees to enable the people of Cambridgeshire to volunteer their services and provisions to help those newly arrived in the area.
