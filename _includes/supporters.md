In 2020, we received a £5000 grant from the Cambridgeshire Community Foundation's Warwick and Dominey Fund. This will support all our core activities, and so help provide English lessons for adult refugees, after-school activities for the refugee children, such as Code Club and Arabic classes, and holiday outings for entire refugee families. We are very grateful for their generosity.

### We are also supported by:

- Daniel Zeichner, MP of Cambridge
- The Rt Revd Stephen Conway, Bishop of Ely
- The Rt Revd David Thomson, ex-Bishop of Huntingdon, who said:

> It’s great to see local people acting together to help welcome, house and support refugees arriving in this country from the Middle East. Bishop Stephen and I in the Diocese of Ely (covering Cambridgeshire and West Norfolk) have written to all our churches encouraging them to act wherever they can. Our key messages are:
> 1.  Act in partnership.
> 1. Offer sustainable rentals.
> 1. Help with emergency needs.
> 1. Go on working as communities to help us all integrate and thrive.
> 1. Consider fostering.
> 1. Pray.

- Julian Huppert, former MP of Cambridge, who said:

> It is awful to see the plight of refugees fleeing persecution in Syria and elsewhere, and to see the lengths they will go to and risks they will take to escape. We are fortunate here in Cambridge and the UK to be able to help people desperately in need, and we have a moral obligation to help. I know people as open-minded and generous as so many in Cambridge are can act, and I hope we will act together to make a difference.

- Dr Aidan Van de Weyer, South Cambridgeshire District Councillor, who said:

> At South Cambs District Council, we are very proud to be able to offer 5 homes to refugee families.
